2025 marked an inflexion point for consulting firms. The year was shaped by a variety of forces:

• Consulting service buyers scrutinising their options and expecting consulting firms to justify the fees based on the value they deliver.

• Tech solution providers expanding into advisory services.

• Large consulting firms increasingly losing bids to smaller, highly specialised firms.

• Old growth models – e.g., growing through headcount and service line expansion – becoming more difficult (and often impossible) to maintain.

• The noise of AI combined with buyers' expectations to utilise AI technologies,+ and a number of others.

It has become abundantly clear that in the coming years, a very specific type of consulting firm will win – one that clearly communicates its value, resolves vital pain points for clients, demonstrates deep expertise and a proven methodology, and is visible through its educational, narrowly targeted content.

Consulting firms that offer a buffet of services will simply be racing to the bottom, offering increasingly significant discounts to drum up new business.

The profitability differences between high-performing and average consulting firms will be more stark than ever. And these high-performing consulting firms will achieve it not by squeezing every ounce of life from their consultants.

In fact, they will be investing in their people more than ever. It will be achieved through constant optimisation of processes – something they can do because their work relies on repetition. They focus on a set of problems, develop highly effective methodologies to address them, run targeted marketing campaigns, and systematise internal knowledge sharing.

Consultancies that continue to rely on generic claims, broad promises, and vague marketing messaging will lose the race. Plain and simple. Nobody wants to buy what they are selling, mainly because nobody can clearly understand the value of what they are selling.

We've been sharing all our learnings from the consulting trenches as we've observed market shifts throughout 2025. And here, in this annual overview, we'd like to present our catalogue of advice on these themes.

• If two partners interpret value differently, the consultancy has already lost the room.

• Silence from prospects is a big red flag.

• Ask ten consulting leaders “what business problem do you solve” and most will answer with ‘what they do’.

• Many consulting firms pour money into sales training and wonder why nothing changes.

# 2025 – The Year Consulting Finally Ran Out of Excuses

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 19 December 2025

## 2025 as the Year of ‘No More Hiding’

2025 was the year consulting came face-to-face with its most fundamental weaknesses. A softer market, brutal budget scrutiny, and a noisy AI wave combined into a straightforward outcome: buyers started asking much sharper questions about where consulting fees actually go and what value they get in return.

The AI hype and the tools themselves hit consulting firms with a double bind.

• On one hand, client expectations for "AI-led transformation" soared, while their willingness to pay traditional fees eroded.

• On the other hand, the tools themselves proved difficult to leverage in a truly differentiating way for such a transformation.

When every consulting firm can access similar technology and generate similar outputs, the only viable way to stand out is through the depth of insight, the quality of the proposition, and the strength of the outcomes delivered over time.

In short, it has been a challenging year, one that we really think marks an inflexion point for the consulting industry. And that’s the lens through which we’ll look at 2025 in this article: the year as the point in time when long-standing habits in consulting started to show deep, structural cracks.

Or, as a consulting firm partner told us: “We seem to have entered a period of painful and public reckoning.”

## The Old Capacity Model Under the Spotlight

For years, the default consulting model has been simple: assemble teams, load them with juniors, sell hours, and wrap everything in methodological language.

Many leaders knew that parts of this model were wasteful. Four people on a one-hour call. Pages of appendices nobody reads. Status meetings that exist only to generate billable time. But clients also accepted all those calls and meaty deliverables, so it worked for everybody, until now.

In 2025, tools like meeting recorders, AI note takers, and simple automation made this visible in a way that is hard to argue with. When software can show who spoke, what was said, who watched a replay, and what was actually used, a lot of ‘standard consulting work’ looks unnecessary.

Of course, these tools rarely replace real expertise. Instead, they made ‘the fat’ more apparent in 2025 than ever before. That transparency puts pure capacity plays under pressure, because buyers can now point to specific activities and ask, very calmly, why they are paying for them.

Increasingly, those questions are no longer hypothetical. Buyers can run a quick AI experiment on a sample of the work and see, in minutes, what used to take junior teams days. Once a CFO has seen that side‑by‑side, it becomes much harder to defend opaque staffing pyramids and vague “analysis” line items on the invoice.

*Recommended reading:Why Big Consulting Firms Need a Better Proposition – Now More Than Ever*

## Broad Promises, Stressed Buyers

In conversations with several consulting firms and big firm practices this year, a common pattern emerged. Their broad, vague positioning is deliberate. They want wide nets. They present themselves as “the partner for everything in your function” or “the expert in your industry”, with almost every topic included somewhere. This worked as long as a strong logo, a wide bench, and senior relationships created enough trust.

2025 strained that equation.

Buyers are under pressure on speed, budgets, and personal risk. They want proof that a consulting firm has repeatedly solved their specific problem and can reduce the risk of failure in their context. At the same time, the AI hype pushed many consulting firms to add another layer of generic language on top, full of transformation claims and ‘AI-led’ promises that sound identical across competitors.

The result is a growing gap between what buyers need to hear to feel confident and what many consulting firms or practices still go to market with. AI is widening that gap at speed. When a client can feed their own data and a competitor’s proposal into a model and ask, “What’s actually different here?”, fluffy language gets stripped away in seconds. Consulting firms that cannot show a real advantage in method, data, or outcomes will increasingly see their decks reduced to interchangeable noise.

A Big 4 risk and compliance practice positioned itself as “the trusted partner for enterprise-wide risk management.” Its website, proposals, and pitch decks all told the same vague story: integrated frameworks, AI-enabled monitoring, global reach. It sounded impressive, but also almost identical to every other large player in the market.Under the surface, much of the work was still delivered through junior-heavy teams mapping controls, compiling risk registers, and producing long reports that clients struggled to act on. In 2025, several global clients piloted AI-driven control-testing and continuous-monitoring tools internally. They realised that basic mapping, document review, and issue tracking could be performed faster and at a lower cost in-house (some of it with the help of basic AI). More informed buyers began to ask, “Why are we still paying for work that looks like everyone else’s and that we can now at least partly do ourselves?"

The partner: "What looks like a small shift in tooling is, in reality, the early stage of a much larger hollowing out of our “baseline” consulting work. As AI models improve, more discovery, synthesis, and first‑draft solutioning might move inside our clients, leaving us exposed wherever our "value" rests on manual effort rather than proprietary insight."

The partner explained to us that a few renewal discussions (retainer contracts) have already shifted from, “How many hours/FTEs do we need next year?” to, “Which specific risk scenarios have you helped firms like ours reduce, by how much, and over what timeframe?” Their broad promise of “holistic risk transformation” suddenly felt thin.

They came to us because they had finally recognised that their generic, copy-paste proposition no longer justified their cost base, and that they needed sharper, outcome-led propositions that a more educated client base could not so easily challenge.

## The Rising Cost of Staying in the Game

Behind the scenes, 2025 also changed the cost base of running a high-performing consulting firm.

For a long time, a consultancy could get away with a lean setup: hire bright graduates, let them learn on the job (paid by the client), give them a few internal templates, and carry headcount as the main investment. That is no longer enough to escape vulnerability to AI-driven disruption. To avoid being overtaken by the competition, consulting firms now face real choices:

• Commit to a focused, differentiated proposition to establish authority.

• Invest in both training and intellectual property (IP) to sharpen the consulting firm’s expertise.

• Invest in data, software, and AI infrastructure to further improve delivery.

Without those investments, firms risk ending up in the same position as traditional law practices or creative agencies: defending hourly rates for tasks that AI can already perform at near‑zero marginal cost. The danger is not that “AI replaces consultants” in a cinematic way, but that it relentlessly compresses "the billable surface area" of every engagement.

Consulting firms that will endure are those that can point to a sharply defined, issue-led proposition for a specific audience, with outcomes proven through repetition and proprietary data rather than promises. They keep turning that experience into differentiating IP that clients actually want to use, not just slides that describe it.

All of these require a change that many of the consulting firms we spoke to in 2025 consider as particularly difficult. It means testing those propositions with real prospects, and then creating a working go-to-market engine around them to strive for the compounding expertise. That work takes time from senior people, causes temporary dips in utilisation, and needs a real budget for research, experiments, and campaigns.

A mid-sized boutique research and market insights firm told us that a substantial share of its revenue used to come from ad hoc projects: quick-turn surveys, basic segmentations, competitor scans, and “rapid insight” decks ahead of board meetings or strategy off-sites.

In 2025, this part of the business shrank materially as clients began generating first‑pass insights themselves, often with the help of AI tools plugged into existing survey platforms and internal data.

The work had traditionally been delivered with a pyramid of juniors designing questionnaires, cleaning data, coding open‑ended responses, and assembling slide decks under senior supervision.

With volumes dropping, the firm decided to cut junior headcount, which now pushes more small, time‑critical requests – “Can you validate this AI‑generated analysis before Monday?” – directly onto senior experts. A double squeeze: less revenue, and a margin hit because higher‑cost specialists are dragged into work that used to be leveraged.

Before 2025, many firms could postpone this work and rely on broad promises that sounded similar across the market. The cost (or ‘tax’) of avoiding that work has gone up.

Each of these paths likely incurs meaningful upfront costs over the next two to three years. Not every consulting firm will be willing or able to make those bets. Larger firms have an advantage here because they have capital and experience with buying their way into new capabilities.

Smaller firms are nimbler but feel every investment decision much more directly. What no longer works is trying to coast on the old “people plus slides” model without any serious investment in depth or enablement.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## The Leadership Gap: From Rainmaking to ‘Product Leadership'

This new cost base also exposed a leadership gap in consulting. Many firm owners and partners built their careers without having to take real investment risk. They built their success on relationships and broad capability-selling, not on focused bets.

When the conversation shifts to pulling people off the bench to build a new proposition, funding dedicated IP work, or committing to well-defined, high-stakes client problems for several years, many leaders hesitate.

In 2025, we heard stories of partners who once excelled at relationship-driven cross-selling and now feel lost and exhausted. Their habits and instincts were shaped by a market that rewarded opportunity-chasing. The next phase will reward different behaviour.

Someone in the consulting firm needs to decide which problems to own, where to invest, what to stop doing, and how to increase project repetition, pattern detection, and reduce outcome variance over time. Clients want outcomes, not project hours.

Another partner told us this move from ‘opportunistic chasing’ to ‘proposition design’ is much closer to (SaaS-like) product leadership than to classic partner rainmaking.

The consulting industry has only just started to face this shift.

## Conclusion: What Winning Looks Like After 2025

Looking back at 2025, one pattern stands out. Firms that treat proposition design, focused project repetition, data codification, and outcome variance reduction as central topics are in a much stronger position than those that treat them as marketing decoration.

Winning firms or practices – large or small – define clear, issue-led, outcome-focused propositions that speak to real, current client risks and challenges. They decide where to build depth and then invest in training, IP creation, data, and methods that support that choice.

They run the same types of engagements often enough to learn from them, reduce surprises, and talk credibly about the odds of success. They are honest and transparent with clients about what they can achieve and what not.

• For larger firms, this often means building more specific propositions at the practice or industry level and backing them with real investment.

• For specialist firms, it means doing fewer things many more times, and talking more clearly about outcome proof and risk reduction.

2025 proved that the age of comfortable, vague capacity selling is over. The real, non-negotiable cost of staying in the game has been exposed, demanding a new level of conviction from leadership.

As AI continues to commoditise baseline knowledge, the ultimate differentiator will not be the tools themselves, but the firm's willingness to make focused investment bets in expertise, proprietary data, and a relentless focus on reducing outcome variance to build outcome-based propositions and proposals.

That's how consulting firms truly gain the trust and competitive advantage needed in the post-2025 era.

# Everything I Wrote About LinkedIn Consulting Firm Leaders Should Know

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 19 December 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/everything-i-wrote-about-linkedin-consulting-firm-leaders-should-know

---

Too many consulting leaders are totally invisible. Sure, they have a LinkedIn profile and a bio page on the website, but that's not even close to enough.

The current consulting market is highly competitive. Buyers are more risk-averse than ever, doing their homework and researching individual consulting firms, their leaders, and solutions to their pain points.

LinkedIn is one of the most powerful tools in my arsenal. It's one of the key platforms where I showcase my expertise, generate ideas for blog articles and future LinkedIn posts, engage with prospects, analyse questions to deepen my knowledge further, and keep my finger on the pulse of my target audience.

I always call it 'my virtual conference room': my marketing asset, my source of inspiration, and my primary lead-generation tool.

Sharing knowledge on LinkedIn isn’t about chasing engagement metrics for me, even though I’m meticulous about reviewing my analytics and tracking my reach. For me, LinkedIn is about demonstrating how I think, how I solve problems for my target audience, what I've learned, and what I observe from the trenches.

And my belief is that it is because of my openness in sharing knowledge that I have been able to build a dedicated audience that continues to grow every day. I don't post what I think my audience wants to hear. I post my thoughts on common pain points that my audience experiences. The difference is subtle but powerful.

I want consulting leaders to use what I've learned about LinkedIn to stop being invisible, to start sharing their knowledge consistently and generously, to engage with their target audience and actually listen to their concerns, struggles, and pain points.

So, here is a compilation of my posts from 2025 that all address this very topic.

#1.My LinkedIn nearly exploded this week.

500 new followers in a day, 100+ direct messages, and multiple collaboration requests. A strong start to the year. Amazing.But here’s the thing: 99% of consulting leaders still don’t believe in LinkedIn!Dear consulting leader, LinkedIn is your live conference room. What I’ve learned from sharing my insights daily over the past years is the power of instant feedback loops.

#2.If consulting firms are invisible in the market, their business runs on borrowed time.

Too many consulting firms are quiet when they should be educating and inspiring. Silence is a liability in a consulting market that thrives on trust and credibility.I’ve seen this pattern far too often: consultancies rely on their immediate networks, word-of-mouth referrals, or the occasional marketing push (in which they don’t believe anyway).

Here’s the problem! Networks shrink, referrals dry up, and the consultancy fades into the background without consistent visibility.

#3.Why are these HubSpot leaders able to show up publicly and share their thoughts so consistently?

...while most consulting firm leaders stay silent?I know the usual excuse. “But Luk, they’re a tech company with a product. It’s not the same.”

Let me be blunt: As a consulting leader, it's YOUR JOB to share your experiences. That's how you build trust in the consultancy's expertise and thinking.

#4.Please REMOVE the OpenToWork badge from your LinkedIn picture!

Those pictures make me sad. Very sad. As consulting firm leaders, we are not for sale!We have 10, 15, 20 or more years of experience, so we present ourselves as ‘Experts in XYZ’ in our LinkedIn bio.If you tell the whole world you are open to work, you risk catapulting yourself into the downstream order-taker space, ready to over-service and under-charge because you have been begging for work.

#5."Luk, our target decision-makers never engage with LinkedIn content."

I hear this line from consulting leaders all the time: “Luk, the executives from our target companies are not on LinkedIn.”Here’s the reality. The high-quality 2025 B2B Thought Leadership Impact Report from LinkedIn and Edelman confirms what we’ve seen again and again in consulting: the real influence often comes from the ‘hidden buyers’ — finance, operations, procurement, compliance, HR.These ‘hidden buyers’ are part of what Alexis Madrigal once called “dark social.” They may not read a lot, they may never post or connect. But they evaluate. And when the big decision moment comes, they often hold the power to say yes, or to quietly freeze the deal.

#6.Consultancy leaders tell me they don’t know what to write about. I don’t get that.

I have shared my expertise DAILY for 5 years. And I have 100s of topics left to write about, straight from the project trenches. Not a single day went by without knowing what to write about.I get between 6 and 7k monthly blog readers (staying on my blog >3’) and 10,000s social media impressions. 90% of my business is digitally generated. Fully booked. Zero outreach. It’s not difficult.

#7.I gained nearly 2,000 new LinkedIn followers during the summer months, but many of their profiles left me scratching my head.

(with zero outreach)Yes, I always check EVERY profile. I also personally thank those who sent connection requests, which account for around 40% of the new followers.Manually. Yes, really. No automation. Because I want to understand the consulting space and its people, I dedicate significant time to it.

#8.“Luk, our target C-level clients don't read our LinkedIn posts.”

Every time I hear it, I smile. Because the assumption is wrong and costly.Consulting leaders still measure LinkedIn success in likes and comments, while the real influence happens off the grid. Private forwards. Quiet DMs. Internal email or Slack channels.A big chunk of my new prospect conversations started because someone forwarded a post I wrote, not because they liked or commented on it, or even because they followed me.

# Why Prospects Freeze. And How Consulting Firms Can Fix It

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

In Aesop’s fableThe Fox and the Cat, the fox boasts of having “a whole sack of tricks” to escape danger. The cat admits to having only one. Yet, when the hounds arrive, the fox freezes, unable to choose a tactic. The cat? Springs up a tree and survives.

Much like the fox in the fable, modern consulting buyers struggle with decision paralysis. How could they not. A simple Google search can lead them down a rabbit hole of options: hundreds of consulting services, just as many software solutions, the possibility of solving a problem in-house, hiring a freelance specialist, waiting and doing nothing, and on and on it goes.

Consulting firms sure aren’t making it easier – 90% of them sound identical, making vague, often grandiose statements that buyers have learned to tune out by now.

In our conversations with both struggling and high-performing consulting firms, we continuously come across the notion of decision paralysis/confidence. It can be spotted in phrases like:

• They seemed interested in our services, but then stopped responding to follow-ups.

• The prospect just kept asking for more information. Nothing seemed to move the needle.

• We don’t have a problem generating leads, but we struggle to convert them.

These mentions instantly signal a consulting firm’s ability level to help prospects build decision confidence. And that’s what I will be discussing in this article.

## Decision Confidence in Consulting – What Is It and Why Does It Matter?

“You have to be a trusted expert on a very specific subject for a narrow audience” – this is the way of thinking that has allowed me to build multiple successful businesses in the consulting space.

It is this mindset that gave me the courage to say no to project requests outside of my area of expertise, to continuously study a narrow set of subjects as I tried to get a more in-depth understanding, and not to hesitate to speak up to clients on the course of action without the fear of alienating them.

My thinking was, and still is: “I am not here to tell you what you want to hear. I’m here to help you solve a problem. And I know exactly how to do it.”

That’s why I was so delighted when I readThe Jolt Effectby Matthew Dixon and Ted McKenna andThe Framemaking Saleby Brent Adamson and Karl Schmidt.

These books helped me conceptualise my operating mode. They put language to what I had long practised intuitively: guiding clients toward decisive action by reducing complexity, narrowing their choices, and boosting their confidence in the path forward.

The fear of making the wrong decision is one of the biggest obstacles in sales, according to Dixon and McKenna. Modern buyers are risk-averse. This fear of action is often driven by omission bias: people feel more regret (or responsibility) for bad decisions they actively make versus things they didn’t do.

It is this risk of action that often makes prospects drop off the face of the earth despite previous interest and engagement. It is this fear of making the wrong choice that puts them in an endless loop of requesting more info and having additional questions.

Adamson and Schmidt explain another angle on indecision: B2B buyers are overwhelmed. They have too many options, access to too much information, and involvement of many stakeholders. This overload makes it hard for buyers to make bold decisions. As a result, they often default to safe, incremental choices. Or they don’t decide at all.

### Building Trust at Scale

Decision confidence is the last step in a consulting firm’s ability to unlock sustainable growth.

Consulting Growth: Building Trust at Scale

I discuss the three layers of trust-building in adifferent article of mine. Here is a quick summary of the layers:

• Value Articulation Specificity(Layer 1): This layer is about clarity – making it obvious to the buyer that the consulting firm truly understands their problem.

• Proof of Value(Layer 2): Repeated patterns of similar projects turn claims into evidence. Proof of value comes in various forms: an ideal client success journey, outcome stories from clients facing similar challenges, thought leadership that inspires action, and so on.

• Decision Confidence(Layer 3): Trust at this level involves assisting buyers to alleviate doubts. By reducing the risks associated with their choices, guiding their exploration, and building shared confidence, consulting firms shift from persuasion to collaboration. It’s not about persuading more forcefully, it’s about helping clients feel secure in making their decision.

In other words, decision confidence is what helps consulting firms close deals with their ideal clients. Layer 1 makes prospects stop scrolling and pay closer attention. Layer 2 demonstrates the consulting firm’s ability to effectively diagnose and solve the problem. Layer 3 helps prospects feel safe enough to act.

Each layer is vital in a prospect’s journey. Unfortunately, many consulting firms seem to forget or ignore the third layer.

## How Consulting Firms Can Help Buyers Build Confidence

Helping consulting buyers build decision confidence is not about pushing harder, continuously explaining the benefits, or engaging in endless customisation. What pushes the needle is consulting firms helping their prospects feel safe in their decision, informed, and supported in making a choice amid complexity and risk.

The benefits of mastering this last layer of trust (assuming that the other layers are also taken care of) include, though not limited to:

• Significant increases in conversion rates

• Stronger client satisfaction

• More long-term relationships and recurring revenue

### Step 1: Understanding the Source of Indecision

Dixon and McKenna explain brilliantly that the fear of making the wrong decision is often the primary barrier to action. Buyers worry about the consequences of a wrong choice. In the context of consulting, this could potentially mean wasting tens, hundreds, or even thousands of consulting fees and weeks or months of employee time.

That’s why buyers repeatedly request information, stall, or disengage completely.

Additionally, consulting buyers are overwhelmed. They have too many options, too much data, and too many voices weighing in.

Understanding thewhybehind prospects’ indecision will help consulting firms understand whether it’s due to risk aversion, information overload, internal misalignment, or something else entirely.

### Step 2: Simplifying the Decision Path

Both books –The Jolt EffectandThe Framemaking Sale– emphasise the importance of simplifying complexity. I experience this daily in our work as well, both in how we engage consulting firms and the advice we give them.

Simplifying complexity is about guiding buyers, helping them eliminate unnecessary options, clarifying trade-offs, and minimising risk.

In consulting, this could mean offering prospects a couple of options for how to proceed at each milestone in the customer success journey, rather than presenting a long list of capabilities and services to impress.

Furthermore, as Adamson and Schmidt stress in their book, sellers should help buyers frame their decisions. That means helping them structure their choices in a way that is understandable and highlights the consequences of each action or inaction.

### Step 3: Providing Evidence that Reduces Perceived Risk

Decision confidence grows when prospects trust that the consulting firm can deliver – Layer 2 in theBuilding Trust at Scalevisual.

This means offering relevant examples of repeated success when delivering on similar projects. It could take the form of case studies, client success stories, testimonials, and so on.

Both books discuss the importance of buyers feeling like someone has successfully navigated the same challenges as they did.

### Step 4: Guiding Exploration

Much of the success of Layer 3 – Decision Confidence – depends on a consulting firm’s ability to guide its prospects. Not manipulate. Not push, not overwhelm with information or a long list of capabilities or options, but rather guide the client.

Consulting firms will achieve stronger results if they assume the role of trusted advisors, encouraging independent thinking and decision-making. This entails helping prospects understand the decision from multiple perspectives, highlighting the most viable solutions, explaining why certain options might be better, walking through the consequences of inaction, and discussing solutions for internal alignment.

Consulting buyers should feel comfortable in their decision-making and feel ownership over it.

High-performing firms act as a “buyer’s agent”, explain Dixon and McKenna. They advocate for the buyer’s success rather than pushing the deal.

Similarly, Adamson and Schmidt reinforce that when sellers help buyers frame their choices, the conversation shifts from persuasion to problem-solving.

Being honest and transparent in this role as an advisor means being truthful in recommending a path, even if that path points to a solution outside the consulting firm (e.g., a different consultancy, a software product, or training that would allow the client to build internal capabilities).

Yes, that means the risk of losing a client in the short term. It also means solidifying trust with that prospect who will not hesitate to recommend the consulting firm to colleagues or other network members (or come back at a later stage).

### Step 5: Moving to Collaboration Through a Low-Risk Entry Point

Easy-to-enter, low-risk entry points allow consulting firms to engage prospects in a way that makes them feel safe. This could be achieved through pilots, proof-of-concept projects, limited-scope engagements, discovery services, or feasibility studies. These smaller commitments allow prospects to dip their toes in without overcommitting and reduce their risk feelings.

*Recommended reading:Every Consulting Firm Needs a Discovery Service*

## In Conclusion: Value Proposition Is at the Foundation of Confidence

“Dear prospect, we have a proven approach to solve your problem that we tailor to your specific context to achieve the biggest possible impact.”

I have shared this sentence many times with prospects who insisted their situation was unique. I have never been challenged. Not once.

If a consultancy has deep expertise in a specific problem (or problems), only the client's context differs. Not the problem.

Prospects always responded well to my sentence because it communicates three things:

• This consulting firm understands the real problem we face.

• It has solved our problem repeatedly and reliably.

• It has a reliable way of helping us succeed in our specific context.

And the only way to confidently claim this is when it’s based on a solid foundation of a laser-sharp value proposition. It’s one of my biggest learnings in the past decade.

Prospects’ decision confidence can’t be built on a consulting firm’s indecisiveness or ‘open-door-strategy’ (accepting everything from everybody). Consulting buyers won’t develop trust toward a consulting firm that can’t articulate its value, can’t prove success, and can’t clearly explain how it helps solve a specific problem.

When consulting firms are confident in their expertise and know how to guide buyers, they give these buyers the courage to act.

# The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 28 November 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-consulting-value-proposition-design

---

Poor value propositions in consulting are widespread; in our everyday experience working with consulting firms both large and small, 98% of consultancies need improvement.

I read an interview recently with a managing partner of a consulting firm. The subtitle mentioned the firm's extreme client-centric approach. Yet the interview was the great “we-we-we” and “me-me” show.

Client-centric? No way. ZERO. Just talking about themselves and their utter greatness. Not a single word about the clients.

It is probably driven by our strong human need for recognition and validation, and the somewhat disproportionate desire of consulting leaders to establish themselves as respected experts in their field. I get that. The need to demonstrate one's expertise is not always negative, as long as the client-centred value proposition language comes first.

Unfortunately, that’s where it becomes an epidemic consulting shortcoming. I see a sea of opportunities for improvement!

In this ultimate guide to consulting value proposition design, I will delve into why mastering a consulting value proposition is non-negotiable for success. I will then explain a design approach that we developed that consulting firms can use as a blueprint for rethinking and redesigning their value propositions – and, as a result, their entire approach to running a consulting business.

Our approach helps consulting define who they serve, what problems they solve, how they deliver impact, and why they exist.

## A Strong Value Proposition = A Profitability Lever

A consulting value proposition isn’t a marketing tagline. It’s the consulting firm’s identity.

In our work with consulting firms, we’ve found that the value articulation is too often treated like a messaging tweak. A new headline. A better pitch. But real consulting value proposition design reshapes everything.

A well-designed value proposition is fundamental to a consulting firm's success, acting as the ultimate determinant of its positioning, maturity, and capacity for sustained growth and profitability. It is not merely a tagline or a messaging tweak, but rather the firm's identity and a profitability lever that reshapes everything about the business.

According to the famousUK BenchPress research(2025 edition), consultancies with a ‘very different’ (meaning: ‘differentiating’) value proposition are twice as likely to achieve fast growth and high profitability. That is a staggering finding!

Based on our experience with consulting firms, here are some key benefits we've identified from strong, well-crafted value propositions in the consulting firms we have encountered or collaborated with.

• Drives Profitability and Growth: A differentiating value proposition is a profitability lever. It enables repeatability and scalability, meaning delivery becomes more efficient and profitable with a well-defined scope. It also supports margin expansion and allows for strategic scaling where growth is repeatable and efficient, rather than being tied solely to headcount.

• Enhances Client Attraction and Sales: Firms with a strong value proposition benefit from stronger client attraction, as the right clients recognise the firm as the best fit for their challenges. It ensures that messaging is not too broad or vague, making lead generation more predictable and consistent. It allows consulting firms to focus on solving specific, urgent, high-stakes issues for clients.

• Enables Premium Pricing: With a clear, differentiated promise, consulting firms can charge premium fees because clients pay for perceived expertise and clarity, not just effort. This helps avoid constant pricing pressure and competing on price instead of value.

• Improves Operational Efficiency: A clear value proposition anchors services in pressing business issues and targets a specific audience, reducing the temptation to say yes to too many projects. This leads to lower operational complexity, increased efficiency, and higher margins by allowing for more standardised and repeatable processes.

• Shapes Firm Identity and Strategy: The value proposition defines who a consulting firm serves, what problems it solves, how it delivers impact, and why it exists at all. It informs thought leadership and point of view. It also helps build a differentiated delivery system – a distinct way of getting clients from Point A to Point B.

• Guides Client Success Journeys: It shapes client success journeys from first contact to long-term impact, ensuring every step reinforces value, reduces friction, and deepens the relationship.

• Provides Clarity and Alignment: A strong value proposition forces clarity, strips away fluff, and helps consulting firms articulate their value compellingly. When internal alignment improves around this clear identity, overall consulting firm performance usually increases as well. It becomes a strategic tool for various parts of the business, including websites & social media presence, pitches, business development, client selection, and operational decision-making.

In short, a well-designed, differentiating value proposition transforms a consulting firm from operating in a reactive mode with growth often being tied to headcount to an efficient, authoritative, and trusted partner that resolves high-impact problems for a targeted audience.

## The Consulting Value Proposition Design Canvas: The Expanded Version

We developed a Value Proposition Canvas tailored specifically for consulting firms or consulting practices. We use it in our project work because it forces clarity, strips away the fluff, and helps firms articulate their value compellingly and practically.

Once completed, this canvas becomes a strategic tool for the website, social media, pitches, business development, client selection, operational decision-making, hiring, onboarding, and training. It also informs the consulting firm's thought leadership strategy.

Within each item in the canvas, we guide our clients through a set of questions that they should answer in order to design their value proposition. In this guide, I will share what those questions are.

### #1. “Our best clients come to us because…”

This starting point establishes a consulting firm’s specialisation. To answer this question, consulting firms need to identify the following:

• Triggers: The circumstances that made these clients feel pain or even realise they have an issue

• Pains: The specific challenges a client struggled with (in their day-to-day) before coming to this consulting firm.

• Issue: The “prototypical,” company-wide, pressing and expensive business issue causing these pains (i.e., the issue the consulting firm will “own”)

Why it matters: Clients do not buy consulting services. They buy a resolution to their urgent, high-stakes issues. This question forces consulting firms to anchor their services in a pressing business issue that clients truly need, not just want. By focusing on clear triggers, pains, and overarching issues, consulting firms ensure their offering resonates directly with client needs, avoiding a vague, capability-first approach like "We do digital transformation".

### #2. “They typically are…”

The next item in the canvas defines a consulting firm’s ideal client profile. Answering this question requires addressing the following sub-questions first:

• Buyer: Who are the typical “buying champions” hiring this consulting firm (demographics, psychographics)?

• Segment: Where do these buyers work (firmographics, other traits)

• Difference: Which traits do typical client companies have in common that differentiate them from other businesses in the category? (e.g., lifecycle stage, strategic motion, …)

Why it matters: This question helps consulting firms target a specific audience/segment. Instead of trying to be "everything to everyone," which leads to a "race to the bottom" and constant price competition, defining an ideal client ensures a consulting firm focuses on the right buyers with budget and urgency. This leads to stronger client attraction and more predictable lead generation.

### #3. “They usually struggle with…”

This item highlights a consulting firm’s strong ability to capture insights. These are the questions that will help consulting firms complete this layer of value proposition design:

• Jobs: What “Jobs” do client companies and buyers have to do to resolve the issue?

• Hurdles: What barriers do they run into when trying to get the job done?

• Options: What options have they tried to relieve the pain? (includes “doing nothing!”)

Why it matters: Understanding these struggles is crucial for demonstrating expertise. It enables consulting firms to attend client calls and meetings by leading with insights instead of merely conducting discovery. This, in turn, positions a consulting firm as a leader from the outset. It helps articulate why previous attempts might have failed, further validating the firm's unique solution.

### #4. “They can expect [x] from us.”

Now is the time to create a promise. In order to do so effectively, consulting firms should first address the following questions:

• Expertise: A firm’s consulting category and core strength (as in: the expertise and capability it brings).

• Impact: The variables the consulting firm impacts through its work, and how they change

• Outcomes: The business outcomes clients typically achieve with the support of the consulting firm.

Why it matters: This defines a clear, outcome-driven impact. It shifts the messaging from "we do X" to "we solve problem X with Y results". A clear, differentiated promise enables premium pricing. It also supports repeatability and scalability by defining a clear scope, making delivery more efficient and profitable.

### #5. “Here is how we help.”

In the final stage, the goal is to clarify how a consulting firm works. These are the sub-items that consulting firms need to address first:

• Point of View: A firm’s view on clients’ issues, and how to best solve them

• Client Success Journey: The ideal series of subsequent engagements or milestones taking a client from issue to outcome.

• Differentiating Delivery: The difference in how a consulting firm guides clients from one journey milestone to the next (the foundations of the consultancy's method, process, or IP).

Why it matters: This component is vital for building a compelling, differentiating delivery – a distinct way of guiding a client from Point A to Point B. This difference might be created by a methodology, a perspective, a set of systems and processes, or simply a combination of expertise domains that is somewhat rare. It shapes the entire client success journey, from initial contact to long-term impact. By standardising and refining processes based on this "how," firms can lower costs, improve quality, and scale strategically without growth being solely tied to headcount.

Below is the infographic summarising what we explained in chapters #1 to #5.

## Example: Value Proposition Design for a Data & Analytics Consulting Firm

While I can’t share all the details our past clients have provided to complete their value proposition canvases, I’d like to use this example, inspired by previous client work, to show how consulting firms can build their value propositions step by step.This example is based on a transformation journey we supported for a client. Over two years, the company shifted from offering generic data and analytics services to focusing solely on improving supermarket chains’ sales forecasting abilities and accuracy. As part of this shift, it redesigned its value proposition using our canvas.

### #1. "Clients come to us because..."

Summary:Our clients are leading supermarket chains that, despite significant investments in data and analytics, continue to struggle with unreliable sales forecasts, complex data environments, and persistently low operational margins. They face overwhelming data volumes and decentralised operations that internal teams and generic providers have failed to resolve. Above all, they seek specialised support to transform this complexity into tangible margin improvement, greater efficiency, and sustainable growth—outcomes that generic solutions and approaches have not delivered.

• Triggers:Chronic forecasting inaccuracies that drive waste, lost sales, out-of-stocks, and excess inventory.Spiralling operational costs (spoilage, stockouts, logistics inefficiencies), worsened by poor demand planning and lack of actionable insights.Internal teams overwhelmed by the volume, variety, and decentralisation of data, lacking either the specialised analytics expertise or the structured methodology necessary to achieve breakthrough results.Dissatisfaction with previous attempts to address these issues, whether through generic data & analytics consultancies or standard software tools unable to handle the scale and specificity of supermarket operations.

• Dissatisfaction with previous attempts to address these issues, whether through generic data & analytics consultancies or standard software tools unable to handle the scale and specificity of supermarket operations.

• Client Pains:High costs from both overstocking (waste) and understocking (lost sales), compounded by challenges in integrating disparate data for a holistic demand view.Ongoing operational inefficiencies across the supply chain, from purchasing through shelf management, as a result of siloed systems and disconnected forecasting processes.Pressure on margins and profitability, limiting the headroom for investment or growth.

• High costs from both overstocking (waste) and understocking (lost sales), compounded by challenges in integrating disparate data for a holistic demand view.

• Ongoing operational inefficiencies across the supply chain, from purchasing through shelf management, as a result of siloed systems and disconnected forecasting processes.

• Pressure on margins and profitability, limiting the headroom for investment or growth.

• Business Issue:Weak supermarket performance and financial stability, caused by unreliable and fragmented sales forecasting and a lack of modern, data-driven demand planning—ultimately limiting profitability, flexibility, and the capacity to consistently meet customer expectations.

• Weak supermarket performance and financial stability, caused by unreliable and fragmented sales forecasting and a lack of modern, data-driven demand planning—ultimately limiting profitability, flexibility, and the capacity to consistently meet customer expectations.

### #2. "They typically are..."

Summary:We partner with leading supermarket chains—most often large, multinational organisations—that have already made significant investments in data and analytics. Despite this maturity, these companies face persistent challenges turning data capabilities into real-world performance gains, especially in the domain of sales forecasting. They approach us not because of a lack of ambition or resources, but because they need specialised expertise and a rigorously structured approach to drive measurable improvements in demand planning, operational efficiency, and financial outcomes at scale.

• Ideal Client / Buyer:Sales Leaders, COOs, or Chief Supply Chain Leaders of multinational supermarket chains.Key stakeholders include CFO, CIO, Inventory & Warehouse leaders, and Category leaders, who need to see quantifiable results.

• Segment:Large, often multinational, supermarket chains and retail companies.Not: small, independent grocers or early-stage startups without complex supply chains.

• Difference from Peers:Proactively seek innovative, tailored approaches rather than settling for off-the-shelf solutions.Demonstrate a strong commitment to measurable results and operational excellence, setting themselves apart from competitors who may tolerate inefficiency or incremental change.Value deep, collaborative partnerships that deliver sustainable, data-driven impact across their organisation.

### #3. "They usually struggle with..."

Summary:Clients have often attempted to improve forecasting internally or by partnering with generic data & analytics consulting firms or software providers, but struggle to implement and operationalise solutions that genuinely reduce costs and increase accuracy. A significant challenge is that internal teams are often overwhelmed by the sheer scale of sales forecasting required, driven by the decentralised structure of supermarket chains and the immense volume of data they must process. As a result, they face internal knowledge gaps and integration challenges.

• Jobs to Be Done:Design and implement a highly accurate sales forecasting system capable of handling the complexity and massive data volumes typical of large, decentralised supermarket chains.Ingest, integrate, and make sense of vast and varied data sources—including historical sales, promotions, external events, and market trends—to build robust, scalable forecasting models.Develop and operationalise new forecasting processes that transform this abundance of data into actionable insights, directly driving inventory optimisation and reducing waste.Ensure that forecasting solutions are both scalable and adaptable, allowing teams to continuously enhance performance as data volumes and business complexity increase.

• Hurdles:Internal teams often lack the advanced data modelling skills and hands-on operational experience required to turn complex forecasting theory into a scalable, repeatable practice.The vastness and decentralisation of supermarket data leads to fragmented, siloed systems, making it difficult to aggregate and analyse information at the speed and scale needed for effective forecasting.Overwhelmed by the sheer volume and heterogeneity of data, teams struggle to maintain data quality, consistency, and integration across functions and regions.Organisational resistance or inertia can slow the adoption of new, data-driven practices—especially when initiatives compete with established processes or require significant cross-functional collaboration.Gaining internal buy-in for complex, analytics-driven change is challenging, particularly when benefits are not immediately visible or require broad behavioural shifts.

• Alternatives:Doing nothing and maintaining the status quo, which often results in ongoing inefficiencies, missed sales opportunities, and further erosion of margins due to poor forecasting accuracy.Relying solely on the internal data & analytics team, who may lack the specialised retail forecasting expertise, experience with large-scale data integration, or sufficient resources to drive significant change at the required pace.Engaging a large, generic data & analytics consulting firm or software provider, which can bring broad technical solutions or strategic advice but often lacks the deep retail and supermarket-specific expertise needed to address unique operational challenges, turning implementations into high-cost, low-impact exercises.Purchasing or customising off-the-shelf forecasting software, which may provide standard functionality but struggles to account for the decentralised, complex realities of large supermarket chains and the integration of diverse data sources at scale.Forming hybrid teams by supplementing internal knowledge with independent freelancers or boutique consultants for niche aspects of the forecasting challenge—though this can lead to fragmented solutions and diluted accountability.Investing in advanced technology platforms (such as AI/ML toolkits or cloud-based analytics workbenches) without a coherent strategy or supermarket-specific adaptation, risking underutilisation and failure to realise return on investment.

### #5. "Here’s how we help..."

Summary: We lead supermarket chains through a focused, multi-milestone transformation that converts overwhelming operational complexity and fragmented data into measurable results. Our approach is pragmatic, collaborative, and designed to empower your teams—blending deep sector knowledge, insight-led design, and disciplined execution for results that last.

After we finished our collaboration with this client (setting up the milestone 1 and 2 value propositions), two years later, they expanded their service offering beyond sales forecasting. By leveraging the solid data and infrastructure built in the early phases, they introduced new advanced propositions that deliver even greater value. These additional services (milestones 3 and 4, customer strategy and store performance) are made possible by the foundational work established in milestones 1 and 2.

• Point of View:"True operational excellence and sustainable profitability in supermarkets are only possible with highly accurate, data-driven sales forecasting embedded across the business. Generic solutions or one-off fixes simply cannot deliver the precision, speed, and adaptability required. Our method ensures a fit-for-purpose journey, not a one-size-fits-all implementation."

## Getting Started with Consulting Value Proposition Design

While the approach to value proposition design is straightforward, it is a highly introspective exercise that requires consulting firms to dedicate time and efforts to. As a result, it may feel overwhelming.

To help consulting firms get started, here is a three-step reflective exercise that we recommend:

• Defining criteria for ideal engagements: This first step involves internal introspection. I encourage consulting firm leaders to ask themselves and their teams: What kind of work would we genuinely like more of? It would help to consider what feels energising, impactful, and aligned with your firm's strategic direction.

• Identifying past projects that (at least partially) fit those criteria: The goal here is pattern recognition, not invention. Here, consulting firms are looking for existing patterns in their firms’ track record that align with their ideal engagements. Reviewing past projects helps ground value propositions in real-world experience and proven success.

• Inquire into those engagements with structured questions: This critical step involves delving deeper into the identified projects to surface the real outcomes a consulting firm has enabled for clients, rather than just focusing on the tools or processes it used. The objective is to understand the tangible impact the firm had, moving beyond mere outputs to quantifiable results and client transformation.

This process serves as a foundational "Client and Work Review," which is a proven method for uncovering the answers needed for a stronger, more value-driven proposition.

## The Shift to a High-Performing Consulting Firm Begins with Value Articulation

The journey of the sales forecasting consulting firm featured in this case study perfectly illustrates what’s possible when a consultancy moves from being a generic provider to building a highly specialised, market-leading consulting firm.

By anchoring every engagement in client outcomes, this firm transformed not only its service proposition and client impact, but also secured its position as a true reference in the market for sales forecasting expertise.

Their evolution—from broad data and analytics work to a focused, best-in-class suite of offerings—demonstrates that a well-crafted value proposition is much more than words on a website or a marketing rebranding exercise.

It is the cornerstone of long-term growth, commanding premium prices, attracting the right clients, and enabling scalable, repeatable success. Every consulting firm stands to benefit from this shift: it requires courage, clarity, discipline, true client centricity, and internal leadership alignment. The rewards are transformative.

If there’s one takeaway from this case, it’s that expertise alone won’t set your consulting firm apart. True market leadership comes from a relentless drive to define, deliver, and communicate distinctive, outcome-driven value. The difference between commoditisation and category leadership is found in your consulting value proposition.

Start building yours. Your future depends on it.

# The Best Consulting Pitch I’ve Ever Seen

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 28 November 2025

This article was last updated on 28 November 2025.

## The setting: a storm of complexity, risk, and scale

A consulting firm walked into a boardroom at a global pharmaceutical organisation that was undergoing a complex merger.

Two legacy organisations, two distinct systems, overlapping CRM and ERP environments, regulatory constraints, multiple countries, and dozens of teams had to be brought together into a single operational reality.

This post-merger ERP integration had to be executed without disrupting ongoing operations, while ensuring stakeholder alignment across regions and functions. The stakes were incredibly high because any mistake had the potential to cost a lot of money, time to success, revenue leakage, and market credibility in an already tense situation.

What made this pitch remarkable became clear very quickly. The client ultimately selected this consulting firm over much larger, global consulting firms, including a Big Four competitor with an established presence in the organisation.

This winning consulting firm’s proposal came in approximately €180,000 higher than the programme budget of around €3 million for this post-merger ERP integration. Despite the higher price, the decision makers chose this consultancy with confidence, trusting its depth of expertise, its specific approach, and its proven ability to manage the immense complexity of the situation.

Several large consulting firms with global reach, strong brands, and broad transformation portfolios had been invited to pitch. Each consulting firm on the shortlist highlighted its impressive service list, wide capabilities, and bold transformation promises. On paper, many of the options looked attractive, structured, and complete.

Then this boutique consulting firm made its move. It did not present anything flashy and did not attempt to match the scale of the others in terms of resource capacity or breadth of offerings. It offered only one very specific proposition, focused entirely on this post-merger ERP integration.

The focus was singular, deliberate, and sharply defined.

For some in the room, the boutique size of the consulting firm felt risky at first. What followed, however, was a pitch that none of the other consulting firms were able to match, because it was built on depth of expertise and accumulated experience in handling the immense complexity of post-merger ERP integrations.

## Why the pitch stood out: mastery through depth of expertise

Unlike others, the consulting firm did not attempt to sell a broad list of services. It did not present expansive transformation narratives or discuss potential future phases beyond this post-merger ERP integration. It stayed firmly anchored in what it knew in extraordinary detail: the disciplined execution of complex ERP integrations in highly regulated, politically sensitive environments.

This narrow focus did not feel like a limitation in that context. It felt precise and intentional. Over many prior engagements, the consulting firm had refined its approach through repeated practice. It had encountered the same types of issues, such as conflicting data structures, stakeholder resistance, compliance challenges, and hidden dependencies, again and again. Each time, learning (including mistakes - some of them explained during the pitch, yes) was captured, codified, and embedded into the delivery process.

This long cycle of repeated engagement in similar high-complexity environments yielded a depth of understanding difficult to replicate. The consulting firm was not simply talking about having completed many projects. It demonstrated the ability to recognise patterns early and anticipate where pressure and resistance would arise during post-merger ERP integrations.

In that room, what the client experienced was confidence grounded in evidence, specificity of experience, and a composed grasp of what this kind of integration actually required, both from the consulting firm and from the client organisation itself, which in turn created a higher level of decision confidence that had not been present in the proposals of the competitors.

## Codified process, informed by repeated exposure to complexity

When the consulting firm presented its plan, each phase of the post-merger ERP integration was laid out in an impressively detailed roadmap. It explained what would take place in the early weeks, how stakeholders would be involved across regions, where approvals and decision points would sit, how compliance requirements would be handled, and how data migration and system access would be managed in an environment of immense complexity.

This was not a conceptual framework displayed on a slide. It was a practical, experience-based execution roadmap shaped by past integrations of similar complexity. It showed where risks typically arise in this type of post-merger ERP integration and how those risks had already been addressed through specific design choices in the proposed approach.

For an organisation navigating a merger of this scale, this level of detail transformed uncertainty into something that could be understood, planned for, and governed. The consulting firm turned an overwhelming, chaotic situation into a sequence of manageable, transparent steps built on deep experience.

## Predictable outcomes as a result of reduced variance

Post-merger ERP integrations are widely known for their volatility. Delays, budget pressure, stakeholder fatigue, and poor adoption are common. The consulting firm approached this challenge by drawing directly on its repeated exposure to similar conditions and levels of complexity. Through this repetition, it had learned to reduce outcome variance significantly.

Based on deep experience from previous post-merger ERP integration projects of comparable scale and difficulty, the consulting firm was able to speak with confidence about realistic adoption levels, anticipated system stability, and the continuity of operations during the transition. It explained where difficulties usually emerge and the mechanisms embedded in its process for detecting and mitigating those challenges early. Really impressive.

This shifted the proposal's context. The conversation became anchored in probability rather than hope. For decision makers who had to protect both the organisation and its revenue streams, this level of predictability carried far more weight than ambitious transformation language.

The immense complexity of this post-merger ERP integration became more manageable because the consulting firm had already reduced as many unknowns and risks as possible through repeated exposure, disciplined refinement, and codification.

## Specificity in the value proposition created confidence

A consulting firm that positions itself broadly can easily create ambiguity, particularly in a high-risk environment. A wide promise often demands faith in areas that have not yet been proven in practice. In this situation, the consulting firm took a very different route by defining its value proposition with strong specificity.

It explained that this post-merger ERP integration was precisely the type of challenge it had committed, many years ago, to mastering. It described how many similar scenarios it had already navigated, and how its approach had been shaped through years of disciplined, focused practice. What it offered was not variety. What it provided was dependable expertise in one highly complex and critical area.

That level of specificity simplified the decision process. Doubt caused by an abundance of options was removed. Ambiguity and risk were reduced. The consulting firm did not attempt to impress through scale or scope. It built trust through precision and proven focus.

## Price difference became a signal of lower risk

When the final proposals were compared, the consulting firm was not the cheapest option. Its bid was approximately €180,000 higher than that of one of the large, well-known consulting firms. On a total programme value of around €3 million for this post-merger ERP integration, this difference could have been an obvious point of hesitation.

By that stage, the discussion had already shifted far beyond initial pricing. Attention was on continuity of operations, protection of revenue, employee confidence, and stability during and after the merger. In that context, the higher price came to represent a greater likelihood of a controlled and predictable outcome.

For decision-makers, the additional investment was acceptable because it was associated with reduced risk in a situation marked by immense complexity and far-reaching consequences.

## What this means for consulting firms that want to succeed

Was this a case of David beating Goliath or a boutique firm outpitching a global giant? Maybe. But most of all, it was a masterclass in what truly wins consulting deals.

Many consulting firms continue to expand their offerings in the hope of increasing relevance and capturing more market share. Over time, this often increases internal complexity, spreads attention thin, and weakens the ability to deliver consistently in highly demanding environments.

The consulting firm in this story followed a different path. It deliberately narrowed its focus and committed to mastering a specific type of challenge, which in this case was post-merger ERP integration. Through repetition, codification, and persistent refinement, it developed a level of expertise that reduced variance, strengthened predictability, and created deep trust among stakeholders.

This approach did not reduce opportunity. It created a different kind of opportunity. One grounded in reputation, proven reliability, and the capacity to operate with confidence in situations defined by extraordinary complexity.

A consulting firm that chooses such a path builds strength through depth rather than through (service) expansion.

## Conclusion: depth, specificity, and compounding expertise shape the strongest propositions

The urge to promise more and to widen the scope is always present in consulting, we are experiencing is every day.

This often results in broader and vaguer messaging, extended service catalogues, and ambitious narratives about what could be possible in the future. This pitch demonstrated a different, more powerful approach.

The consulting firm grounded its story in what it knew deeply. It focused solely on this post-merger ERP integration. It relied on years of repeated work, accumulated learning, and codified practice. It converted immense complexity into a structured, comprehensible,  and lowest-possible-risk path forward.

In addition to its deep expertise, the consulting firm was also perceived as highly transparent, credible, and authentic, with a leadership team whose reputation reinforced trust in its ability to deliver.

In high-stakes environments, decision makers place value on stability, predictability, and the confidence that complexity has been understood and accounted for. This consulting firm met those expectations through specificity, depth of knowledge, and disciplined execution.

The fact that the organisation selected this consultancy over a Big Four counterpart, despite a price difference of approximately €180,000, was not an accident. It was a direct result of how risk, certainty, and trust had been framed during the pitch.

For any consulting firm reflecting on its future direction, one question stands out. Perhaps the most significant advantage does not come from trying to do more, but from choosing one critical problem, committing to it thoroughly, and mastering it to a level where outcomes become predictable even amid immense complexity.

That is what made this the best consulting pitch I have ever seen.

# Why Big Consulting Firms Need a Better Proposition – Now More Than Ever

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 18 November 2025

---

The big-firm consulting model is under pressure.

Clients are savvier and more selective, growth is harder to come by, and, yes, softwareisreplacing much of the low- and mid-level work that used to keep the large firms’ engines running.

In response, consultancies are shifting. Strategy shops are moving downstream into implementation. Tech consultancies are pushing upstream into advisory. Everyone is converging toward the middle andstarting to sound the same.

This is leading to a crisis of differentiation. In part because offerings become even more similar, in part because the knee-jerk response of many players is to lean even harder into “capability-selling”: service portfolios expand, offering lists grow, everybody “leverages AI” and has their own proprietary chatbot.But that no longer builds trust or wins business. It pushes firms into a spiral of race-to-the-bottom commoditization,with some clients already asking for AI-driven discounts.It’s crystal-clear that something will have to give. And we’re convinced it's not consulting itself (as we’ve pointed out here), but the capacity- and investment model of large, broadly positioned consulting firms.

Because we think that in today's market, a true edge won’t come from a firm's brand, bench, or talent alone, but from the clarity of its proposition.

Because it – and only it – will make a difference in winning better work from better clients, winning the best talent for a consulting firm’s specific business, and building truly differentiating IP while the middle of the market collapses.In this article, we provide our step-by-step breakdown of why the model is crumbling and how large firms can respond.

## The Old Growth Model Is Crumbling

For decades, large consulting firms grew on the back of a simple formula:

• Hire juniors,

• Train them up,

• Scale delivery capacity through headcount,

• Monetise reputation and breadth of services.

That model worked well. Until it didn’t.

• AI and automation have taken over many of the support tasks. AI does research, mapping, PMO, and synthesis faster and better than juniors. What used to require an army of analysts can now be accomplished with a fraction of support staff at marginal costs.

• Buyers do their own homework. Senior executives now do their own diagnosis and shortlist selection: read thought leadership articles, map out options, gather recommendations from colleagues and larger networks. And they do so long before speaking to a consultant.

• Talent alone isn’t a differentiator unless the firm knows how to position it. Large firms are no longer competing among each other. They are competing against solo specialists, specialised boutique firms, and tech providers. It’s not enough to say “We have talent”. Firms should be able to clearly demonstrate the unique value that the talent delivers.

All of this to say that the traditional firm structure of big teams, broad offerings, and a generalist growth playbook is out of sync with modern market dynamics. And the cracks are showing.

*Recommended reading:AI Is Not Destroying Consulting. It’s Raising the Bar.*

## Why Proposition Design Now Matters More Than Ever

In our work with large consulting firms, we see the same pattern repeating:high capability, weak proposition.

Instead of showing how they help clients solve specific, high-stakes issues, many firms default to showcasing scale:

“We have 75 consultants in 12 jurisdictions for this practice.”

That’s capability-selling, and it quietly kills differentiation, commercial clarity, and pricing power. It also creates three major risks:

### #1. Sea of Sameness: Everyone Sounds Identical

“We help clients achieve growth and transformation”“We bring deep industry expertise”

Generic claims make even the most powerful firms sound like their smaller peers. Buyers tune out. They gravitate toward firms that articulate a real point of view, with a sharp focus on a pressing problem they recognise.

### #2. Buyer Disconnect: Clients Are Left to ‘Connect the Dots’

Listing services isn’t the same as showing relevance. When firms lead with capabilities instead of problems solved, buyers are forced to guess whether and how those capabilities apply to their situation.

In a competitive market, clients won’t waste time making that mental leap. They will simply move on.

### #3. Internal Chaos: Lack of Clarity Breeds Strategic Drift

Without a clear proposition, firms chase scattered opportunities. They spin up new offerings to chase deals, expand into sectors with no clear advantage, and create layers of messaging that don’t add up.

The result? Confused marketing, siloed teams, fragile margins, and burned-out talent stretched across too many priorities.

## A Strong Proposition Isn’t Just About Messaging. It’s a Strategic Reset

To thrive in today’s market, large consultancies need to move fromcapability-sellingtoproposition-selling:

• From what theydo, to why clientschoosethem.

• From vague claims, to issue-led, outcome-driven narratives.

In our work with large, multi-service consulting firms, we prioritise helping them make three key shifts:

### #1. Strengthen the Overarching Proposition (and Sub-Propositions)

Every firm needs a unifying narrative – a clear story about who they serve, what they solve, and why clients should trust them.

In large consultancies, this story often gets diluted across siloed practices. That’s why it’s essential to:

• Define a compelling overarching proposition. We see so many firms trying to be everything to everyone – whether due to the lack of internal alignment or in a desperate attempt to attract new clients. This leaves the proposition vague or full of meaningless generalisations. That’s why, before anything else can happen, consulting firms need to design a compelling narrative that clearly signals to prospects the firm’s deep understanding of their problems and the expertise to deliver meaningful outcomes.

• Align every sub-practice’s “use case story” to that core. Large consulting firms should strive to operate like a mechanical watch, where every gear, spring, and wheel serves the unified goal of keeping track of time. Each practice has its own use case story. However, it must reinforce the overarching proposition at the foundation, not dilute it.

• Create coherence between the firm’s big story and its everyday conversations with clients. A proposition is useless unless it helps frame daily conversations, both internally and externally. When a proposition helps navigate marketing discussions, sales pitches, and all other messaging, it creates cohesion in how prospects perceive the consulting firm, which facilitates trust.

*Recommended reading:How to Structure Multiple Value Propositions Without Losing Your Firm’s Identity*

### #2. Reorganise Around Client Issues, Not Internal Silos

Sometimes the service portfolio itself becomes the problem.

Legacy offerings, misaligned acquisitions, and opportunistic expansions often create drag on clarity. That’s why we often help firms:

• Evaluate which services reinforce vs. dilute the overall proposition. It’s dishearteningly common to see firms propping up legacy services or underperforming practices by taking away resources from better-performing service lines. That’s why it’s crucial to make the hard step of making evidence-based decisions on which service lines to cut and which ones to grow further.

• Refocus the portfolio around client-centered issues. Enough with the long lists of services. What is each service line solving for its ideal clients? That’s the question that should be at the core of operations.

• Sunset or reshape services that don’t serve the long game. Not every offering needs to exist forever. Some might be outdated, others were intended to be a one-time service offering but got extended indefinitely. Some might have potential but need repackaging and optimisation.

We aren’t talking about just editing a service list. It’s about refocusing the firm’s operating model around its strategic edge.

### #3. Redefine Service Lines as Boutique-Grade Practices

Each service line should operate like a boutique consultancy within the broader firm, with its own defined audience, issue focus, success journey, and outcome promise.

When this happens:

• Practices become commercially powerful in their own right.

• Talent can actually succeed because they’re working within a clear, credible frame.

• Sub-propositions support the firm’s master narrative—like puzzle pieces forming a coherent whole.

## The Business Case: What Firms Can Expect

Here’s what a strong, issue-led proposition unlocks:

• Coherence: Unified value across siloed service lines.

• Strategy: Tactics aligned around clear commercial goals.

• Stronger entry points: Easier market access through issue-led campaigns.

• Pricing power: More perceived value, less discount pressure.

• Shorter sales cycles: Clearer value = faster decisions.

• Scalability: A narrative that enables repeatability, not just one-off wins.

• Talent traction: Experts want to work for a firm with conviction and clarity.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## The Maturity Journey: From Noise to Growth

In our experience, consulting firms that take on this journey typically go through three stages of commercial maturity:

Consulting Value Proposition Maturity

### Phase 1: Commercial Clarity (0–3 months)

Before the redesigned overarching proposition and optimised service lines can have any impact externally, they must take root internally. That means marketing teams need to re-think their strategies, consulting teams need to internalise the new messaging and start reframing their conversations with clients, team leaders need to adjust how they manage their teams, recruit new talent, and communicate across departments.

That’s why, at this stage, the main outcomes are:

• Sharper proposition, clearer messaging

• Stronger early-stage engagement

• More focused and qualified pipeline

### Phase 2: Commercial Impact (3–12 months)

Now that internal changes are more or less settled in, consulting firms can expect to see some external results. It’s becoming less of a struggle to attract and convert the right prospects, marketing messages are receiving stronger engagement, and consulting teams don’t find themselves struggling to justify the prices as much.

Some of the most visible indicators in this phase are:

• Shorter sales cycles

• Greater pricing power

• Better client expansion

### Phase 3: Structural Scalability (12+ months)

Phase 1 is about bringing internal changes, Phase 2 is about testing out these changes externally to collect proof, and Phase 3 is about scaling. Now that it is evident that the new system is working, consulting firms can start taking advantage of the firm-wide sales power, where it is no longer up to a couple of rainmakers to bring in the clients. Individual consultants, marketing executives, senior leaders – everyone is communicating a unified narrative.That’s why at this stage, consulting firms typically experience:

• Less founder- or partner-dependent growth

• Repeatable business development

• More stable, reliable pipeline

## Conclusion: Clarity Is the New Consulting Edge

The impact of AI goes beyond changinghowconsulting is delivered. It’s forcing firms to rethinkwhatthey are.

In a world where talent is no longer scarce and clients have near-perfect information, the real differentiator isn’t the size of a consulting firm or its slides.

It’s the proposition.

Because without a clear, focused, and credible proposition, talent can’t thrive, buyers don’t care, and growth doesn’t scale.

Capability-selling builds complexity. Proposition-selling builds commercial strength. The firms that embrace this shift will define the next era of consulting.

# How Consulting Firms Can Build Trust at Scale

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 04 November 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-consulting-firms-should-ditch-vanity-claims-and-how-they-can-build-trust-at-scale

---

Consulting success is built on ‘trust at scale’. And too many consultancies don't get that.

According tofindings by Source, 94% of CxOs said they consume thought leadership “often” or “sometimes” – up from 84% the previous year. Anotherstudy by Sourcereported that, in recent years, the strongest differentiators among consulting firms have been deep industry knowledge and access to subject matter experts.

Thought leadership,subject matter expertise, andvisibility– all these notions fall under the umbrella of communicating and building trust.

Yet most consulting firms try to build trust with vanity claims:

• We transform your organisation

• We drive substantial growth

• We deliver impact and results

They believe bold outcome language signals confidence. In reality, it erodes trust. What consulting firms see as their transformational expertise, buyers often read as a lack of substance.

Real trust is built when a consulting firm proves that it:

• deeply understands the buyer’s problem,

• has done the required transformation multiple times before, and

• is experienced in helping buyers make confident decisions.

That’s how consulting firms prevent stalled or ghosted proposals: by replacing persuasion with predictive trust that converts interest into commitment. And that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article.

## Consulting Clients See Through Vanity Claims

Vanity claims – high-impact promises that sound confident yet lack substance – are useless. Modern buyers see right through them. In fact, they are so widespread that decision-makers treat them as background noise.

Buyers are more informed than ever. Their decisions are driven by independent research, hyper awareness of budget restraints, and the need to minimise risk. So when a consulting firm relies on grand claims without delivering meaningful specifics, consulting service buyers take it as a sign that the consultancy doesn’t actually have the means, expertise, or experience delivering the claimed value.

And that’s how trust erodes.

Because buyers are not looking for a consulting firm that makes the loudest, boldest claim. They are looking for one with deep expertise, a thorough understanding of the buyer’s problem, and a proven strategy for resolving it.

When a consulting firm makes generic statements full of consulting jargon (‘empowering your digital transformation’ and the like), it forces its target audience to connect the dots and figure out this firm’s relevance and capabilities. And most buyers won’t do that. Not in the highly competitive consulting market.

That’s why it comes as no surprise that high-performing consulting firms consistently win business. They make it easy for their buyers to decide to engage. Instead of trying to entice prospective clients with bold but ultimately meaningless statements, they show how their deep expertise can solve very specific problems effectively. That’s the foundation of their trust-building.

## The Three Layers of Trust

Trust is not created overnight. It accumulates. The good news is that past a certain point, it has compounding effects.

In our work with consulting firms, we’ve learned that trust has three layers:

Consulting Growth: Building Trust at Scale

### #1. Value articulation specificity – the foundation of trust

The first layer is about clarity – making it obvious to the buyer that the consulting firm truly understands their problem.

When the value proposition is sharply defined (i.e., issue-led, outcome-driven, audience-specific), the buyer instantly feels, “This consultancy gets it.”

Specificity creates familiarity. It tells the client, "We’ve solved this before." And it does so way more convincingly than “we deliver amazing outcomes” statements.

### #2. Proof of value – the reinforcement of trust

Specificity opens doors; proof of value gets consultancies invited in. Buyers are cautious decision-makers who need reassurances that the risk is minimal (or non-existent).

Repeated patterns of similar projects turn claims into evidence. Proof of value comes in various forms:

• An ideal client success journey

• Outcome stories from clients facing similar challenges

• Thought leadership that inspires action

All of these help grow trust in the buyer’s mind:“They’ve done this repeatedly and reliably.”

### #3. Decision confidence – the enabler of trust

Too many consulting proposals are lost not to competitors but due to client hesitation. In one of my favourite books,The JOLT Effect, Matt Dixon and Ted McKenna explain that buyers rarely doubt the service firm. They doubt themselves.

They're grappling with questions like:

• Have we explored all the alternatives? (afraid of not having done enough research)

• Can we really implement this successfully? (concerned about the internal capabilities)

• Are we making the best decision for our company? (not sure if this is what they need)

• Could I get in trouble with this decision? (career threat)

Trust at this level involves assisting buyers to answer those questions carefully but confidently.

By reducing the risks associated with their choices, guiding their exploration, and building shared confidence, consulting firms shift from persuasion to collaboration. It’s not about persuading more forcefully, it’s about helping clients feel secure in making their decision.

## How a Consulting Point of View Turns Trust into Influence

While value articulation specificity, proof of value, and decision confidence are qualities or characteristics to aim for, a consulting point of view (PoV) is a mode of communicating trust.

A PoV frames why buyers’ challenges exist, what’s changing in their world, and why this consulting firm is uniquely positioned to help address them.

A consultancy’s PoV informs all external and internal messaging.

To help consulting firms develop a strong PoV, we have designed this canvas:

The Consulting Point-of-View Canvas

We offer an in-depth explanation inour article on consulting PoVs,but here is the gist:

The canvas maps the client’s journey from yesterday to tomorrow:

• Yesterday (the status quo): This describes how things currently work for clients.

• The downside of the status quo: Here, consulting firms have an opportunity to highlight why the current way of operating is unsustainable.

• Tomorrow (the ideal state): This is the consulting firm’s vision of how things should work.

• The upside of changing: Finally, consulting firms can show the benefits of moving from the status quo to the transformed state.

Additionally, the canvas is divided into three “lenses” to make sure a PoV is grounded in the client’s reality:

• How their world works: This lens captures the external environment in which clients operate. By articulating these forces, consulting firms showcase their understanding of the broader context shaping prospects’ challenges and opportunities.

• How their organisation works: Here, the focus shifts inward – to the client’s structures, systems, and ways of operating, with consulting firms highlighting where friction occurs.

• Where they focus: This lens looks at the leadership agenda in clients’ organisations and what keeps senior-level decision-makers up at night.

Trust is the antidote to clients’ indecisiveness. Using this framework, consulting firms can build trust with clients across the three layers discussed earlier.Recommended reading:How a Consulting Point of View Turns Expertise Into Influence

## In Conclusion: Trust Is the Only Real Differentiator

When consulting firms get all three layers right – 1) value articulation specificity, 2) proof of value, and 3) decision confidence – they can create trust at scale. This is what separates consulting firms that win consistently from those that end up chasing prospects and have to offer discounts to compete.

And in a consulting market drowning in sameness and AI-generated noise, trust becomes the only real differentiator left.

Firms that replace vanity claims with a clear point of view, demonstrate a proven track record, and guide clients to confident decisions become true partners to their clients.

Trust is not optional in this day and age. It’s at the foundation of sustainable growth in consulting.

# The Real Reason Why Cross-Selling in Consulting Often Fails

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 21 October 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-cross-selling-in-consulting-often-fails

---

“If only our partners worked together more, revenue would grow exponentially.” Ah, the illusion of cross-selling that many consulting leaders buy into.

The theory behind cross-selling efforts is simple – and justified: utilise existing relationships with clients to deliver more value to these clients.

In practice, however, cross-selling rarely works like that.

The problem isn’t the lack of effort. It’s not even about the principle of cross-selling. The problem is wrong design choices.

Without creating a set of connected services that centre around the same pain point and cater to the same target audience, cross-selling will most likely fail to deliver expected results as a revenue generation tool.

In this article, I will dive into why that is the case and offer an alternative strategy that high-performing consultancies excel at.

## Why Cross-Selling Does Not Deliver on Expectations

We come across the problem of cross-selling frustration on a regular basis when working with consulting firms.

What do most of them have in common? What they call “cross-selling” is, in reality, a monthly scramble for extra revenue.

The problem in these consulting firms is almost identical: a business has multiple service lines with partners leading each group of services. Each group is optimised in its own silo – by capability, industry, or geography, for example.

This disjointed, significantly isolated mode of operating multiple service lines creates the following barriers:

• Competition: Service line leaders are not motivated to sell service offerings from a different service line for fear of losing their clients.

• Lack of thorough understanding: Even if service line leaders don’t worry about losing clients, they do not have enough expertise and experience selling a different set of services. They lack the depth of knowledge needed to explain in a straightforward way what pain points this group of services will help resolve and how it can impact the larger picture.

• Fragmented client experience: Oftentimes, clients end up receiving inconsistent, uncoordinated messages and proposals from different parts of the consulting firm. This leaves clients feeling uncertain about the capabilities of the firm, uninformed on how the different service lines come together to solve a larger underlying issue, and unsure how to proceed.

• Reactive business development: There is no culture or an established set of processes and systems that encourage and facilitate cross-selling. Instead, it’s done as a result of a meeting where a senior leader, anxious about revenue numbers, pushes service line leaders to engage in cross-selling. Or, once a month, the partners sit together, review client accounts and ask: “What else can we sell to clients A, B, and C?”

## The Real Problem: A Disconnected Portfolio of Services

• We just need a unified business development strategy!

• We are missing an account-based management system.

• All we need is a synchronised go-to-market strategy.

We’ve heard it all from consulting firms trying to make cross-selling work.

Yes, in a few instances, these changes worked. Unfortunately, in most cases, they crashed and burned. Why? Because the portfolio of services is disconnected, and no amount of “unifying on the messaging” can fix a foundational problem like this one.

Consulting leaders are quick to blame revenue problems on sales and marketing shortcomings. However, that’s not the root cause. The problem in these consulting firms is of design nature.

Their service offerings developed organically over time. For example, one partner created an offering from scratch in response to a client request. Another one launched a whole niche capability after hiring a specialist. A third one expanded on the services offered to a key client.

Before long, this firm has a patchwork of unrelated services that lack a unifying proposition.

Instead of addressing the root problem and going back to the drawing board, leaders of these consulting firms choose to justify this chaos with “revenue diversification” arguments.

That’s why they continue to live in denial when profits take a nose dive and push cross-selling initiatives or hire dedicated business development specialists.

*Recommended reading:Hiring a Business Development Leader Will Not Fix Boutique Consultancies’ Growth Problems*

Cosmetic changes like “unifying messaging” rarely work either. Messaging can only amplify what’s already there. It can’t create alignment among disjointed services.

## The Alternative? Portfolio Optimisation Design – Embedding Cross-Selling in the Design

So if cross-selling initiatives don’t work, what’s the alternative? Or rather, what are the conditions that make cross-selling seamless?

Portfolio optimisation design.

Portfolio optimisation is the strategic design and alignment of service offerings in a manner that collectively and individually, they support the overarching proposition centred around clients’ pain points. No single service exists in isolation.

Service portfolios can be optimised at the overarching level or, for larger consulting firms, at the level of service lines, industries, geographies, or other segmentation parameters.

As shown in the visual, at the foundation of portfolio optimisation design is an overarching proposition that connects the dots, linking the client’s pain points to the outcomes they want to achieve.

Service offerings are organised along a clear client success journey across the firm’s expertise domains.

Medium and large firms often have multiple industries or segments that they cater to. In such instances, service portfolios can be organised along those segmentations (industries, geographies, etc.). What matters is breaking the silos and presenting one coherent problem-to-resolution structure.

*Recommended reading:How to Structure Multiple Value Propositions Without Losing Your Firm’s Identity*

Consulting firms that go this alternative route and put time and effort into optimising their service portfolios around a proposition experience growth that’s delivered by design, not improvised:

• Cross- and up-selling becomes natural. It’s no longer senior leaders pushing the service line leaders to cross-sell. Rather, clients naturally progress through the portfolio as they are guided through the client success journey.

• Internal alignment improves. Since breaking the silos is at the heart of portfolio optimisation design, collaboration between teams becomes seamless. There is no competition for client ownership as the entire team aligned around the incentive to contribute to the success of a unified client journey.

• Value articulation improves. When services are connected around the same client outcomes as opposed to siloed internal departments, articulating value for individual team members becomes easier. This, in turn, makes it easier for clients to understand the entire journey and buy the portfolio of services – or at least the next logical step in the journey.

• Messaging gets unified. When value articulation gets clarified, external and internal messaging is strengthened. From sales and marketing specialists to junior consultants to senior experts – the entire organisation works on amplifying the same core message around the value proposition of the consultancy.

• Further optimisation and resource allocation become more efficient. When there is crystal-clear visibility into which services along the client success journey deliver outstanding outcomes vs which ones dilute the proposition, it becomes easier to continuously optimise it. Resource allocation becomes more efficient along the way as well – e.g., it becomes easy to spot which services can share systems, tools, or processes.

## In Conclusion: Cross-Selling Is Not a Meeting Agenda Item

It’s a proposition design choice: how the consulting firm structures and communicates its portfolio so that growth is built in rather than bolted on.

When a firm’s services are designed around clients’ pain points and come together in a unified client success journey, cross-selling happens naturally.

The conversation shifts from “What else can we sell?” to “What is the next logical step in helping the client achieve the ultimate goal?”

Unfortunately, too often, cross-selling becomes a band-aid for siloed practices and/or revenue stress.

Sure, it might generate some short-term revenue, but it’s not sustainable and, as a result, without the service design foundation, not conducive to long-term growth.

Growth is designed, not improvised.

# How to Assess Consulting Growth Potential Using the 5R Model

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 07 October 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-to-assess-consulting-growth-potential-using-the-5r-model

---

Due to my experience working with consulting firms, I am regularly asked by acquisition teams – be it investors or large consultancies – to act in an advisory capacity.

(Not so) fun fact: far too many consulting firm acquisitions fail at the root.

I saw it first-hand.

As a member of acquisition assessment committees, I reviewed dozens of boutique consulting firms that looked great on paper.

• They had strong topline growth.

• Their margins looked really good.

• Their leadership teams consisted of exceptional experts.

However, the financial due diligence and leadership interviews only gave part of the picture. Some firms were commercially fragile. Their “good on paper” status was either luck or a result of short-term strategies.

They were not designed for sustainable performance.

That’s why, next to the usual due diligence, we used an additional lens. We called it the 5R model.

I’ll discuss this model in the article, along with which growth factors appear to be the hardest for consulting firms to embed in their daily practices and long-term strategies. The 5R lens isn’t only useful when a consulting firm is looking for buyers. It’s a way to test whether the business is truly built for long-term success.

## The 5R Model of Consulting Growth Assessment

The 5R Model forces consulting firms to ask the hard questions.

First, here is an overview of the model.

Now, let’s zoom in on every growth dimension.

### #1. Reputation

Question to ask:

Does the firm carry absolute authority in its market, or is it invisible without organic introductions?

Why it matters:

Consulting firms with strong authority in their market don’t need to cold-call prospects, chase opportunities, and hustle for every introduction. They are known as the go-to experts for a very specific set of problems. They own an issue.

This level of authoritative reputation drives inbound opportunities, pricing power, and revenue reliability. Clients seek out these firms.

Furthermore, reputation offers compound interest – the more visible a firm is, the more opportunities it attracts, the more recognition it gets.

Without a strong market reputation, growth depends on luck and personal networks.

### #2. Repetition

Question to ask:

Are there repeatable and compounding offerings and patterns of engagement, or is every project a one-off?

Why it matters:

Repetition separates consulting firms that can scale from those that are forever stuck reinventing the wheel.

Repeatable models scale. They create efficiency, enable consulting firms to set up proprietary methodologies, processes, and systems, and facilitate a predictable mode of work for employees.

One-off projects mean constant reinvention and zero compounding momentum. Every project is custom, which means margins are unpredictable and often erode. Growth depends on finding “the next big client” or increasing the headcount.

Furthermore, repetition is how consulting firms reduce variability in outcomes over the long term. It enables consulting firms to achieve predictable results with each client engagement. This outcome-based consulting is both a powerful way to close new deals and is the perfect defence against AI disruption.

However, outcome-based consulting doesn't emerge from a clever template. It results from focus and repetition, running similar projects over and over again. Recognising the same problems across organisations and identifying patterns. Connecting the dots, compounding the insights, and reducing outcome variance. This can’t happen if a consulting firm accepts everything from everyone.

Oftentimes, consulting firms end up increasing their service portfolio to attract more opportunities, which, ultimately, results in them diluting their value proposition.

*Recommended reading:What "Outcome-Selling" Really Means for Consulting Firms*

### #3. Retention

Question to ask:

Do clients return and deepen relationships, or do they disappear after the first project (hitting the project wall)?

Why it matters:

Retention instantly shows whether a firm delivers enduring value. The ability of a consulting firm to turn an initial project into long-term partnership signals their ability to deliver on their promise and the trust they are able to build with clients.

It’s also often a sign that the consultancy is deliberate about creating a client success journey, helping clients achieve the ultimate goal through a series of success milestones.

High retention lowers acquisition costs. Low retention typically means that a consultancy is under constant pressure to chase new business.

### #4. Reliability

Question to ask:

Does the firm show revenue reliability with a stable pipeline, or is it living with constant ups and downs?

Why it matters:

Reliable revenue makes firms investable, acquirable, and less stressful to run. A reliable pipeline of revenue allows consulting leaders to make medium- and long-term plans, whether it’s in terms of hiring new staff members, investing in technology tools and other resources, upskilling employees, or experimenting with new/refined offerings.

Instability, on the other hand, burns cash, leadership, and culture. It erodes margins and makes it impossible to make any meaningful long-term strategic calculation. Decision-making is reactive, not proactive.

### #5. Return

Question to ask:

Is there genuine pricing power and profitability, or just revenue with thin margins?

Why it matters:

Return is the ultimate test of how much client attraction, pricing power and operational efficiency a consulting firm has. Sustainable profitability funds growth, attracts talent, and protects against downturns.

Thin margins signal weakness. These firms are in constant survival mode. Sure, there might be a few ‘rain-makers’, but when the entire business model and its success depend on a couple of charismatic leaders, long-term prospects are quite grim.

## Which Growth Levers Are the Hardest for Consulting Firms to Embed?

“Luk, which of these growth factors trip firms up most often?” – a network member on LinkedIn asked me this question. It’s a great question, so I want to address it here in full.

The most commonly missing growth levers are repetition and reliability:

• Repetition: I’ve seen too many consulting firms run on the brilliance of founders – outstanding experts or highly-connected networkers. These firms have lots of clever one-offs. There are too few standardised, compounding offers. You’d see every proposal rewritten from scratch, hero delivery, no playbook. No repeatable pattern = no scale. Without repetition, growth gets stuck in “project mode.”

• Reliability: Pipelines are on a never-ending rollercoaster ride in way too many firms that I’ve assessed. They would have a couple of anchor clients or a rainmaker, which created the illusion of stability. However, forecasts were hope-casts. Variance killed confidence.

Close behind are return and retention:

• Return: It’s common to see consulting firms with thin gross margins despite happy clients. The culprit was often day-rate thinking – pricing based on effort as opposed to transformational value. Senior time gets written off and delivery variance eats the margin. Without strong margins, every downturn becomes an existential threat.

• Retention: At first glance, many consulting firms look okay. Digging deeper reveals their overdependency on one sponsor or one use case. Cross-sell and expansion often happens by accident, not by design. I see too many firms stopping at “they liked us” rather than using that as an opportunity to design a client success journey that would provide these clients with ongoing value.

Reputation is the least often the blocker.

• Reputation: Many consulting firms that I audited have a good name in a niche. The problem was turning that name into client attraction with repeatable, reliable, high-margin work. Often, consulting firms fail to take their good name beyond one-off opportunities and instead convert it into a pipeline of stable work with a bulk of revenue coming from existing/returning clients. Yes, reputation can open doors, but without the other Rs, it doesn’t sustain organic, high-margin growth.

Here is a quick test that consulting firms can do. Answer these two questions:

• Could the consulting firm run its flagship engagement three times this quarter without rewriting the deck?

• Could it lose the top two clients and still hit the plan?

If not, the gaps are Repetition and Reliability :-).

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## In Conclusion

Looking at firms through the 5R lens allowed me and other assessment committee members to separate the ones with real consulting DNA from those running on opportunism.

The firms that thrived showed scalability and resiliency. They were highly profitable due to optimised costs, low client acquisition costs, repeatable processes, and pricing power.

The ones that struggled were held back by structural gaps, be it the lack of optimised, repeatable, scalable processes, unreliable pipelines, or transactional one-off relationships with clients.

So here’s the reflection I’d invite every consulting leader-owner-partner to make: If we were to assess your consulting firm tomorrow with the 5R model, how would it score?

Which Rs are your strengths, and which ones are quietly holding your firm back?

# What "Outcome-Selling" Really Means for Consulting Firms

**Autor:** Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 23 September 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/what-outcome-selling-really-means-for-consulting-firms

---

If you're a regular reader of our articles (or anything we publish), you'll have read us write this before:

Many consulting firms lead with their capabilities – and it simply doesn’t land.

• “We implement SAP.”

• “We integrate AI.”

Sure, it tells people what a consulting firm does. But it doesn’t give them a reason to care. It puts the category of expertise at the centre, rather than the problem being solved or the outcomes that can be achieved. And it leaves the prospect doing the heavy lifting to figure out if ‘the category’ can help them.

Outcome-selling flips that.

It reframes the pitch around what clients actually want: business results.

However, let’s be clear, this doesn’t mean making guarantees that consulting firms can’t control. Consultancies are not running their clients’ business, after all.

Rather, consultancies should be in a position to link the work they do to the impact they create... and to the outcomes this impact typically drives.

So let's explore this step by step.

## What Outcome-Selling Is, and Isn’t

Let’s clarify one thing before we dive in: outcome-selling might not be what you think it is (we find it's widely misunderstood in this industry). Some appear to believe that it’s about guaranteeing highly specific outcomes – e.g., “20% lower costs in 6 months.” Others assume it’s about taking full accountability for client-side results.

But that’s not quite it. In fact, how could it be? Consulting firms don't control the decision-making, resourcing, or execution context within the clients' organisations. They are not running clients’ teams. They are not in the driver's seat. And clients are very well aware of it, by the way.

So if outcome-selling isn't about ironclad promises and money-back guarantees, what is it?

It's about focus and commercial clarity, not control.

Outcome-selling means making a strategic choice about which outcome a consulting firm exists to serve. It's about putting its expertise in the service of a business result that its clients care about. And the more specific a consultancy can be about it, the more powerful its proposition becomes.

Instead of vague statements like:

"We help with AI and automation."

Outcome-selling is the pursuit of translating expertise and capabilities into tangible business impact:

“We use AI to reduce IT's time-to-ticket resolution without adding headcount."

The former is generic. It prompts clients to connect the dots and understand how a consulting firm’s expertise can potentially benefit them. The latter is actionable and tied to measurable value. That's a direction buyers care about. It's grounded in business value. And it makes consulting work relatable and relevant.

*Recommended reading:How a Consulting Point of View Turns Expertise Into Influence*

## Why Outcome-Selling Makes for a Stronger Foundation

Too often, consulting firms put all their time and energy into highlighting their activities and services. They are selling inputs: time, capacity, or capability:

• “We help with AI."

• “We’re your Workday implementation partner."

• “We’re supply chain experts."

The real issue with this stance?

It puts the burden on the prospective client to figure out how your expertise fits their world. They're left thinking, “OK... but what do I do with this?”

That dynamic – where the consulting firm shows up with tools but no clear application – has fuelled decades of cynicism (remember the old line about consultants borrowing your watch to tell you the time?).

Today, many clients simply don’t have the patience – or the budget – for that kind of guesswork. It makes engagements feel transactional, commoditises the value of the work, and ultimately eats into pricing power.

Selling outcomes is different. It means making a promise that resonates with the consulting firm’s target market. It makes for a more reliable foundation for creating a sustainable business with strong growth potential:

• External clarity: By framing the value of consulting work around outcomes – or tangible business impact – clients gain clarity. It instantly helps them understand what end goal the consulting firm is trying to impact as opposed to all the different processes it plans to engage in.

• Internal clarity: Outcome-selling puts the entire consulting firm on a focused "mission" to understand, fulfil, and improve around. When the focus shifts from tasks or deliverables to specific outcomes, every team member is on the same page in terms of what the firm is trying to achieve for its clients. Such clarity can simplify decision-making, prioritisation of tasks, and collaboration. This applies to both consultants working on project execution and marketing specialists amplifying the firm’s messaging.

• Continuous improvement: The more often a consulting firm works on the same kinds of issues, in the same kinds of contexts, with the same kinds of clients, the more confidently it can start to quantify your results – e.g., "Other clients regularly see TTR improvements of ~28% and relative cost savings of ~30%".

• Trust-building: Instead of overpromising, outcome-selling enables consulting firms to clearly communicate their focus and experience in impacting a specific, meaningful matter. This transparency and grounded expectations help consulting firms build and sustain trust with their clients.

These are the real payoffs of focusing on a consulting proposition and refining the delivery model.

## Does an outcome-based proposition lead to outcome-based pricing?

There is a growing chorus of AI advocates claiming that outcome-based consulting naturally leads to outcome-based pricing. That claim needs some pressure testing because it mixes two very different questions:

• One is how a consultancy frames its work for commercial clarity.

• The other is how that work is priced.

They can be connected, but they are not the same thing.

For readers familiar with our writing, they know our point of view: outcome-based consulting propositions grow from project repetition and compounding pattern recognition.

A consulting firm needs enough similar engagements to speak with confidence about the results it can achieve for its clients. Yet even with that clarity, a consultancy still does not control client politics, execution choices, culture, or resources. Outcomes depend on many forces outside the consulting firm’s reach.

That is why the current argument that AI will accelerate outcome-based pricing feels misplaced. AI does not shift the control a consultancy has over downstream outcomes.

An outcome-based proposition helps a consulting firm sell with more precision because it frames the work around a result the client actually cares about. Outcome-based pricing introduces something else entirely. It transfers financial risk. A consultancy can only attempt this when it has delivered similar outcomes often enough that variability has dropped and patterns are strong.

Here's an excellent LinkedIn comment fromJonathan Hughes:“The majority of consulting engagements are simply not large enough in scope such that the consultant can deliver a meaningful outcome. AI is not going to cause clients to award consultants projects with vastly larger scope so they can pay for outcomes. Even outsourcing contract fees are not fully outcome based."

Outcome-based propositions should be encouraged. Outcome-based pricing should be treated with caution.

## Outcome-Selling – Where To Begin

Here’s the truth: you can’tdeclarean outcome strategy. You have toearnit.That means repetition – not reinvention. You build credibility through doing similar work, for similar clients, solving similar problems. Over time, you spot patterns, sharpen your method, and get clearer on the results you can speak to with confidence.

Outcomes aren’t invented in a workshop. They’re uncovered and proven in the field – through patterns, refinements, and client success over time. This hands-on experience is what allows a consulting firm to move beyond theory and speak authoritatively about results.

It enables firms to build client success journeys that show how each milestone brings clients closer to the high-value endpoint. It allows consultancies to see the bigger picture, enabling them to establish true partnerships with clients rather than engaging in one-off projects or service delivery.

That’s why consulting firms that continually expand their services struggle to build outcome credibility. Each new service resets the learning curve. It delays the clarity and proof that outcome-selling requires.

So where do you start?

• Pick a business problem you solve best. Not just something you can do – but something where your firm consistently drives meaningful impact. It needs to matter to clients and be big enough to care about.

• Define the outcomes you make possible. Base them on real work, not aspirational scenarios. Ground your message in what you’ve actually helped clients achieve.

• Tell the transformation story. Don’t just describe services – connect the dots. Show clients how your method, experience, and track record move them from where they are to where they want to be.

Once this is clear, everything else gets easier. Project scoping, messaging, and team alignment all reinforce the same direction.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## In Conclusion

Please, remember: "Outcome-selling" isn't about promising the moon. It's about focusing efforts and showing what's possible, and then delivering it again and again.

By shifting to this approach, consulting firms create both internal and external clarity and build trust with clients. Focus and repetition enable consultancies to transform their service portfolio into a roadmap that delivers meaningful business impact.

This, in turn, changes the perception of a consulting firm from a vendor to a real business partner.

# How Consulting Firms Can Overcome Prospects’ Indecisiveness

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 19 September 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-consulting-firms-can-overcome-prospects-indecisiveness

---

“87% of sales opportunities contain either moderate or high levels of customer indecision.” This is one of the research findings from Matthew Dixon and Ted McKenna in their book 'The Jolt Effect' (see further).I find this number shocking, especially since the research also found that 40-60% of potential deals with customers who express their intent to purchase ultimately result in no purchase.We see the numbers support what we see daily in our work and in our communication with consulting firm owners, partners, or leaders. One of the main challenges they present us with is failing to break through the wall of hesitation. Prospects show initial interest but then disappear, and the dozens of follow-ups the consultancy sends end up in a dark, mysterious void.So why are prospects so hesitant to make a purchase? And what can consultancies do to reduce hesitancy and maximise their chances of winning new business? These are the two questions I’ll be addressing in this article.

## Why are consultancy buyers hesitant?

I recently read a book that significantly impacted me – 'The JOLT Effect: How High Performers Overcome Customer Indecision' by Matt Dixon and Ted McKenna, and I recommend it to everyone in consulting.The authors explain that there are three reasons for clients' indecisive behaviour:

• Clients are worried about choosing the wrong option.

• Clients are concerned that they haven’t done enough homework.

• Clients fear they won’t get what they’re paying for.

This book stood out because of its relevance to the consulting industry. When I looked back at our conversations with consulting firm partners, owners, or leaders, and reviewed the pages of notes we had taken, I saw how eerily similar the behaviour of consulting service buyers is.

## The Fear of Messing Up

The authors refer to the 'fear of messing up' as an essential factor in prospects’ indecisiveness. This is the anxiety and hesitation customers feel about making the wrong decision.What drives this fear? The potential negative consequences of making a wrong choice (to name a few):

• Risks associated with their choices

• Judgement from peers, colleagues, and supervisors

• An overwhelming number of choices

• Potential for future regret

The foundational fear manifests in several behaviours:

• Procrastination: Delaying making decisions to avoid the anxiety associated with committing to a potentially wrong choice.

• Seeking excessive information: Going overboard with research in an attempt to validate a potential choice.

• Defaulting to the status quo: Sticking to existing solutions or making no change at all.

Let's break down the three main findings from the author's research.

#### 1. Prospects are worried about choosing the wrong option

This problem stems, first and foremost, from the prospects’ lack of understanding of the root causes of their problems.

While they are acutely aware of the everyday friction, getting to the bottom of the issue falls outside their scope of expertise. That’s why they are looking for external counsel, an expert consulting firm to come in and resolve the issue.For example, if a multinational company’s strategic initiative is not delivering expected results, is it due to (1) employees’ improper adoption of new processes, (2) misalignment and poor implementation of the strategy, or (3) the strategy itself being the wrong choice for the company's needs?

#### 2. Prospects are concerned that they haven’t done enough homework

• 75% ofB2B buyers prefera rep-free sales experience.

• 77% ofB2B buyers saythey will not talk to a sales rep until they have conducted their own research.

There are dozens of statistics like this on the purchasing behaviour of B2B buyers, including those of professional services buyers.They all point to the same reality: prospects do their research before even considering working with a specific consultancy.However, how much homework is enough? In my experience, prospects often worry they haven’t done enough homework. This is where a consultancy can make a significant impact. If a consulting firm can confirm that the buyer has done thorough research and explain why, it provides a substantial vote of trust.

This validation relieves the buyer, giving them peace of mind and increasing their confidence in working with the consultancy.

#### 3. Prospects fear they won’t get what they are paying for

A modern buyer of consulting services is results-oriented. They, like everyone else, live in uncertain times. Budgets are volatile. Business complexity has increased. Decisions are interconnected. Stakeholders are numerous.Buyers are not looking for big, empty words and promises from their partners. They are no longer impressed by wining-and-dining old-school strategies. They are sceptical of sales pitches.They want reliable outcomes. They want transformative results. They aim to minimise risk while maximising output.That’s the reality of a modern buyer.

## How can consulting firms address the indecisiveness of prospects?

For consulting firms, the solution to prospects’ indecisiveness comes down to two action points:

• Educating the audience rather than selling to it

• Having a clear and compelling value proposition backed by social proof

#### 1. Building trust and helping the audience gain a deeper understanding of the root causes of their pain points through education-driven thought leadership

I avidly advocate using value-driven audience-education marketing to generate new business. I believe the traditional sales model is outdated, as evidenced by the reasons I listed earlier for clients’ indecisiveness.Consistently producing and promoting educational content, on the other hand, is a strategy that helps consulting firms achieve numerous wins:

• More robust engagement: Educational content tailored to a target audience’s pain points and problem areas generates significantly more engagement than dull sales “look how great we are” content. It’s exponentially more likely to be shared by others, turn a regular prospect into a loyal reader, and receive higher overall visibility.

• Trust-building: Educating the audience means generously sharing the consulting firm's knowledge and expertise. This inevitably builds trust with prospects, who are much more receptive to proposals from consultancies and consulting leaders they already feel they know.

• Discoverability: Consultancies that regularly produce value-driven content on specialised subjects are more easily discoverable. Their content will appear in AI-based research when prospects search for possible solutions to their pain points. It will also appear on professional networks like LinkedIn because the target audience is sharing it. Colleagues will send it to each other as a helpful resource.

• Prospects' pre-qualification: When educational content focuses on the specific problems of a particular group, it functions as a pre-qualifying tool. It signals the parameters of a consultancy’s expertise to prospects, weeding out prospects outside the target audience.

• Stronger clarity of prospects' problems: Through educational efforts, consultancies can help their prospects gain a deeper understanding of the root causes of their problems. This, in turn, will help them be more decisive when picking out the right consultancy for their needs.

#### 2. Setting up the parameters of work and expectations through a crystal-clear value proposition and outcomes-focused social proof

The second aspect of resolving indecisiveness is establishing clear expectations with prospects.That’s where consulting value propositions come in.

A well-designed value proposition offers prospects the following information:

• Why clients come to the consultancy

• What clients usually struggle with

• Who the typical client is

• What clients typically achieve by working with the consultancy

• How the consultancy can help

• When prospects should reach out to the consultancy

• What the entry service is – how to get started

• What the pillar themes of thought leadership are

When concise, this information can be shared with a prospect in less than a minute. It’s a powerful way to explain what the consultancy does, who it collaborates with, how it can assist, and what the outcomes will be.This creates specific parameters for prospects’ expectations. They enter the partnership knowing exactly what they will achieve, which helps them minimise risk and be more confident about the value they will receive for their money.Social proof bolsters the claims of a value proposition. Here, I’m referring to case studies and testimonials.However, not all case studies and testimonials are created equal. The “John is a great guy to work with” kind of fluff will not cut it. Instead, I strongly encourage consulting firms to examine their past client work and create case studies that clearly identify the pain points, how the consultancy resolved them, and the tangible results.

Prospects want to know that about a consultancy, not whether John is a great guy.Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design

## In conclusion

Overcoming prospects' indecisiveness is a significant challenge for consulting firms, but it is not insurmountable.

The key is to prove to the prospect that they won’t fail by choosing the consultancy’s expertise. Their primary concern is FOMU, the fear of messing up.

It's not about convincing them to change the status quo.

To achieve this, consultancies must inspire, educate, motivate, and activate their prospects.

# AI Is Not Destroying Consulting. It’s Raising the Bar.

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 09 September 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/ai-is-not-destroying-consulting-its-raising-the-bar

---

Consulting is not dead. Stop the nonsense.

Everywhere I look, the same headline: “AI is destroying consulting.”

Even serious media outlets are jumping on the bandwagon, recycling the same tired narrative. Apparently, consulting is just analysis, data crunching, and slick PowerPoint slides, soon to be replaced by AI.

If that were true, the industry would have collapsed long before ChatGPT. Back in 2017 – years before generative AI went mainstream – areport by McKinsey Global Institutefound that approximately 45% of activities performed by consultants could be automated using existing technology.

Yet, every year, new reports would show relentless growth of the consulting industry.

• “Strong growth by Europe’s largest consulting markets has lifted the continent’s consulting industry to a record high of $45 billion last year” (Consultancy.eu)

• “The dramatic growth of the industry between 2020 and 2023 has proven that companies need external consultants with strategic knowledge about business administration, business development, as well as expertise about the industry in which clients operate.” (Statista)

Yes, certain consulting business models have been on a downward trajectory for a decade now and AI tools have only accelerated the inevitable. However, not only do I strongly disagree with the claim that AI is destroying consulting, in my experience, AI is redefining the value that consulting firms could potentially deliver to clients for the better.

## What the AI Hype Gets Wrong

Let’s be clear. That version of consulting – the bloated, slide-heavy, junior-stacked model – is getting under pressure. Good. It should. But that’s not what real consulting is.

Real consulting work is:

• Sitting in front of a Fortune 500 CEO and helping them align a divided exec team during a critical transformation. It’s navigating internal politics, resolving strategic deadlock, building momentum, and owning the messy, uncomfortable work that follows.

• Helping companies defend against cyber threats that evolve by the hour. It’s guiding supply chain redesigns across disrupted global networks. It’s steering post-merger integrations where technology, often multi-year ERP programmes, can’t afford to fail. These are not slide deck problems. They require lived experience, deep expertise, and on-the-ground judgment and execution.

• Leading businesses through culture and organisational change at scale. It’s coaching senior leaders to adopt new ways of working, embedding new processes across diverse teams, and ensuring that strategy translates into real, measurable results.

Try automating that.I’ve been called in by CEOs many times for one reason: the outside view. And the questions were about judgment and anticipation.

• “How do you think we’re doing?”

• “Are we missing something?”

• “What friction should we expect in 3, 6, 12, or 24 months?”

• “How can I handle leadership scepticism?”

• “How do clients usually respond?”

• And always:“What would you do in our position?”

Try automating that.

Here is what a commenter on LinkedIn wrote: “But so much of consulting is BS anyways.” Quoting a study, they argued that "38% of corporate executives feel comfortable letting AI make decisions on their behalf (even though we know AI likes to make stuff up)."

So not much difference to what's happening now anyway, corporate executives and boards for that matter feel comfortable outsourcing decisions to consultants and we know they make a lot of stuff up... as evident with all the BS frameworks and unsupported "theories" they are spruiking.”

Here is my response: Not in my experience. While in some corners of management consulting, there’s been a reputation for hand-waving, that’s a very narrow slice of a much broader industry.

We work with consulting firms in, e.g., IT modernisation, supply chain optimisation, PPM, post-merger ERP integrations, financial security, risk management in banking, revenue data and analytics – and many more.

These are high-stakes environments. If they were making things up, they simply wouldn’t stay in business. So let's not confuse the experts with the wannabes.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## How AI Is Reshaping the Consulting Industry

Yes, the consulting model is evolving rapidly. AI is reshaping how consulting firms deliver value. It’s less about generating faster slide decks and more about capturing expertise, systematising insights, and reducing dependence on brute-force headcount.

Some consulting firms are turning their methods into codified tools. Others are building internal AI copilots to support delivery at scale. The boldest are redesigning their service model entirely, blending human expertise with machine intelligence to deliver faster, more repeatable outcomes with fewer people.

There's no doubt, AI is transforming consulting. And you know what? We love it. We are in the trenches of that transformation. We love having access to tools that can take care of the boring stuff that previously had to be handled manually. It frees up more of our time to focus on the work that actually matters: solving complex problems, advising clients on critical decisions, and applying judgment and experience where it counts.

### Application Examples

So while AI can handle many repetitive tasks, consulting itself – a multi-billion dollar industry solving real, high-stakes business problems – is very much alive.

In our work with consulting firms, I see that it’s not so much about AI versus humans. Rather, it’s about AI with humans. For example:

• Many data and analytics firms now utilise AI tools to clean data and build charts. This allows them to reduce hours spent on tedious tasks. Their consultants then focus on interpreting the findings, contextualising them for the client, and recommending actionable strategies.

• We’ve seen consulting firms use AI to create a functional archive of internal knowledge. Past project learnings, case studies, and expert insights can be indexed and surfaced instantly. This means consultants don’t have to reinvent the wheel with every project. They can simply access best practices and lessons learned.

• AI can help drastically reduce the amount of time spent on operational tasks: scheduling, project tracking, resource allocation, internal reporting, and so on. AI facilitating such routine work frees up consultancies’ time towards client strategy, relationship management, and execution.

Yes, clients’ expectations are changing. Yes, many things that they hired consulting firms in the past to handle are now being executed by AI tools. What can’t be replaced though – and never could be – is expertise, judgment, creativity, empathy, or stakeholder management, to name a few.

My fellow readers and network members on LinkedIn tend to agree with my assessment of the state of consulting vis-a-vis advancements in AI:

• “What AI can and should do is strip out the operational drag, the slide factories, and the illusion that volume equals value, Luk. But we all know that real consulting begins where playbooks end. It requires presence, judgment, and often the uncomfortable task of telling the truth when no one else will.”

• “Completely agree.. Yes AI has made analysing data easier and preparing fancy report, but that is not consulting.. As a consultant you need to understand the stated and unstated problems and find a solution that works. Sometimes solution is evolved over multiple rounds of discussion. Can AI understand unstated problems.”

• “As a brand consultant, I think what AI - both the reality, and the hype - is doing is forcing me to think about the real value that I and my team bring to our clients. Sure, some of that is research and analysis. Frameworks and tools. Solutions and statements. The creative outputs and marketing plans. And probably most - maybe all - of that could be delivered by an AI tool with some push and pull. But that senior leader who needs to eyeball someone who's been there and done it before, ask them: "What do you see?" / "What really needs to change?" I don't see that going anywhere anytime soon.”

## Beyond the AI Noise: The Complex Reality of Consulting’s Recent Struggles

What we have seen and observed in the past year is that if AI has contributed to challenges in consulting revenue and growth, it's primarily been due to the hesitation caused by the pervasive AI noise, which has led to clients delaying decisions to hire consultants.

Beyond this, many of the recent growth struggles in certain consulting expertise domains (though certainly not all) stem from a confluence of broader economic factors, including global economic pressures, disrupted global supply chains, and budget cuts on the client side, to name a few.

Furthermore, consulting firms have faced hiring challenges in securing top experts, and the post-COVID revenue decline, following an incredible boom immediately after the pandemic, has also played a significant role, factors often overlooked by those who singularly blame AI for consulting's struggles.

## Preparing for the Inevitable AI Questions

Irrespective of one’s position on AI, one thing is undeniable: AI is now part of the conversation. Prospects, existing clients, procurement teams, and C-level executives are going to ask questions like:

• “How are you using AI in your work?”

• “Will AI replace your team?”

• “Why should we pay for humans when a machine can do it faster?”

In my opinion, instead of avoiding or redirecting these questions (which can cost them credibility), consulting firms should be prepared to address them directly and cohesively.

Consultancies don’t need to pretend AI doesn’t exist. I also discourage consulting firms from overhyping it. Instead, it’s about showing that the consultancy is using AI thoughtfully and strategically – as a tool that enhances the process, not as one that replaces human expertise.

It will serve consulting firms well if they can illustrate their point with examples of case studies where AI supported their work yet the outcome relied on human expertise.

## In Conclusion

Consulting isn’t dying. What is happening is far more interesting. AI is helping reshape the consulting industry. It’s being reimagined by people who care deeply about doing it better.

There is no avoiding the future of consulting. Yes, some consultancies will struggle – the slide-heavy, junior-stacked model will continue getting under pressure. That’s a good thing because it sharpens the industry as a whole. It removes the low-value work. It puts a spotlight on consulting businesses that deliver transformational value.

I believe that the consulting industry will be thriving because consulting firms will learn to work smarter, better, and faster with AI by their side. And I, for one, am excited about the future of the industry.

# How a Consulting Point of View Turns Expertise Into Influence

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 26 August 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-a-consulting-point-of-view-turns-expertise-into-influence

---

“We publish content regularly, present at events, experiment with various marketing campaigns across different channels – yet, nothing seems to be working. We are still struggling to generate quality leads.”

This probably resonates with a lot of consulting firms. We hear it from prospects and clients on a regular basis. Marketing and business development campaigns often fall flat, so consulting firms keep trying new things: new platforms, new messaging, new sales decks, new topics.

Similarly, sales conversations seem to lead to dozens of followups and constant discussions of prices. It makes sense why so many consulting firms feel stuck.

So what is missing? Why do some consulting firms get constant engagement – be it prospects reaching out, articles reshared, or leaders invited to present at industry conferences – while most get lost in the crowd?

In eight or so of ten cases, it’s a strong, differentiating point of view or perspective - the firm’s “flag in the ground” which clearly signals how its experts think and work.

## What Is a Point of View (PoV) in Consulting?

A PoV in consulting is a firm’s view on clients’ issues and how to best solve them. It’s this firm’s distinct perspective on what’s changing in their clients’ world, what causes the changes, and what they should do about it.

Don’t confuse this with a tag line, a sales pitch, or a recital of generic industry trends. Rather, it’s the core belief along which a consulting firm – and all its team members, from marketing to consulting teams – operates, interprets its market, and positions itself as a category leader.

In ourUltimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design, we list PoV as a crucial element of Step 5: Clarification of Work.

After showing a deep understanding of the clients’ pain points, the PoV frames why those challenges exist, what’s changing in their world, and why this consulting firm is uniquely positioned to help address them.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

## Why Does a Consulting PoV Matter?

A sharp, differentiating PoV frames both external messages and internal operations.

• It helps consulting firms cut through the noise. A clear PoV differentiates firms from the crowd by going beyond simply reciting market trends. It explains what is happening in a particular segment and why, it showcases a consultancy’s expertise on the consequences of inaction or missed opportunity costs.

• It helps shape a firm’s identity and market authority. Yes, consulting is an expertise-driven business. However, clients don’t just buy expertise = capability. They are looking for high-value transformations. A well-crafted PoV signals that a consulting firm deeply understands their challenges, has a distinct interpretation of how to resolve them, and, most importantly, has a proven roadmap to deliver the transformative outcome.

• It creates urgency and supports premium pricing. Facts alone don’t necessarily drive change. A PoV highlights the risks of maintaining the status quo as well as the upside of acting now. It reframes a client’s situation in a way that shows just how costly inaction is.

• It reframes sales conversations. Instead of responding to endless RFPs with proposals that detail dozens of capabilities or competing on price, consulting firms with a strong PoV lead conversations about the future of their segment, which, in addition to influencing buying decisions, allows them to help clients rethink their strategy as a whole.

• It directs delivery and IP creation. A strong PoV doesn’t just shape how a firm shows up in the market – it also clarifies how it should engage with clients once work begins. By anchoring delivery to a clearly defined perspective, firms can focus engagements on what truly drives value, rather than diluting efforts across too many directions. This clarity accelerates the development of services, standards, frameworks, and processes, ensuring that intellectual property is not only consistent but also directly reinforces the firm’s distinctive stance.

A PoV is not a marketing gimmick. It’s a bridge between a consulting firm’s expertise and its clients’ challenges. It’s what differentiates run-of-the-mill consulting firms from the ones that shape how clients see their challenges and macro trends in their segment.

## Can a firm have multiple PoVs?

Every firm will naturally develop multiple points of view – perspectives that address the challenges their clients face, the shifts within their industries, and the opportunities on the horizon.

These diverse viewpoints are valuable, but they shouldn’t exist in isolation. A firm also needs one defining, firm-wide point of view that rises above the rest – a prime perspective that shapes its identity and differentiates it in the market.

When done well, the relationship between these ideas forms a hierarchy: the primary point of view anchors the firm’s positioning, while the secondary perspectives reinforce and elaborate on it, adding substance, nuance, and credibility.

Together, they create a coherent narrative that helps clients see both the bigger picture and the practical steps within it.

## How to Extract a Point of View That Stands Out: The PoV Canvas

To help our clients distill their internal and external messaging into a PoV that clearly articulates their distinct interpretation and approach to client work, we have designed a PoV canvas.

At its core, the canvas maps the client’s journey from yesterday to tomorrow:

• Yesterday (the status quo): This describes how things currently work for clients. It forces consulting firms to capture the norms, practices, and assumptions that define their day-to-day reality. Without this grounding, a consulting PoV risks sounding abstract or disconnected from the actual experiences and observations of clients.

• The downside of the status quo: Here, consulting firms have an opportunity to highlight why the current way of operating is unsustainable. This is where firms highlight the tension, the urgency – a clear articulation of risks, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities. Afterall, if the status quo seems comfortable or “good enough,” there’s no reason for clients to act.

• Tomorrow (the ideal state): This is the consulting firm’s vision of how things should work. It’s not about selling services directly. Rather, it’s about painting a picture of a better, more effective way forward. It’s about helping clients see their challenges and opportunities in the same light.

• The upside of changing: Finally, consulting firms can show the benefits of moving from the status quo to the transformed state. It’s about making benefits feel tangible, giving clients a clear sense of reward for taking action. This part translates a consulting firm’s PoV from an observation into a call to action.

Furthermore, the canvas is divided into three “lenses” to make sure a PoV is grounded in the client’s reality:

• How their world works: This lens captures the external environment in which clients operate – industry shifts, regulatory changes, technological disruptions, evolving customer expectations, and so on. By articulating these forces, consulting firms showcase their understanding of the broader context shaping prospects’ challenges and opportunities.

• How their organisation works: Here, the focus shifts inward – to the client’s structures, systems, and ways of operating. Through this lens, consulting firms can highlight where friction occurs internally and why certain challenges persist despite investment or effort.

• Where they focus: This lens looks at the leadership agenda in clients’ organisations and what keeps senior-level decision-makers up at night. By showing a thorough understanding of what’s top of mind for them, consulting firms connect their PoV directly to the decision-makers’ priorities.

*Recommended reading:The Value Proposition Gap: What Consulting Firms Say vs. What Clients Hear*

## The PoV Canvas: Examples

Example 1: Consulting firm for media organisations

This consultancy works with large media organisations, helping them identify viewership trends and plan content accordingly to ensure consistently high engagement and audience retention.

Example 2: Consulting firm for retail brands

This consulting firm helps retail brands identify operational inefficiencies in their supply chains and resolve them.

## A Strong PoV = One of the Foundations of a Differentiating Value Proposition

Firms that invest time in articulating their PoV are able to clearly differentiate themselves from competitors, build authority, and create urgency that motivates clients to act. It helps firms stand out, strengthen its relevancy, and explain their value.

By using the framework of the PoV Canvas, consulting firms can ground their perspective in the realities of their clients’ world, clarify the value of moving from the status quo to a better future, and guide conversations toward transformation rather than transactions.

Ultimately, a compelling PoV is what turns expertise into influence.

# Consulting Clients Don’t Have a Tool Problem

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 08 August 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/consulting-clients-dont-have-a-tool-problem

---

In the last couple of years, we have worked with a wide range of IT and software consulting firms that deliver critical solutions to enterprise clients. We observed a shared challenge across the ecosystem: the default tendency to lead with technology.

It makes sense. Many of them offer powerful products. Teams are trained on them. There’s a strong sense of ownership around features and capabilities. But clients rarely buy technology for its own sake. They’re not experiencing a tool problem. They’re facing delays, complexity, risk, and performance gaps.

This provides a vital opportunity for software vendors to move from technology-centric messaging to problem-oriented, outcome-driven service propositions.

In our work with high-performing service teams, this transition has proven to be the most significant factor in establishing credibility, delivering value, and achieving long-term client impact.

## The Default: Tech First, Services as Support.

Many vendor-aligned services teams still focus on implementation and optimisation. “We’ll help you get the most from the software or the platform.”

This isn’t a differentiated value proposition. It assumes the client already believes the tool is the answer. But if the real problem hasn’t been identified or the business context hasn’t been clarified, services risk becoming reactive, commoditised, and hard to grow.

We encourage technology providers to move upstream, lead the conversation, and translate technology into meaningful business progress. This begins by rethinking how services are framed.

## Clients Buy Outcomes. Not Tools.

We have seen repeatedly that clients don’t buy tools. They buy progress. The most successful service proposals start by identifying a problem. A bottleneck. A risk. A source of friction. Only once that’s understood does the discussion move to solutions. Only then does the technology come into play, not as the main focus, but as an enabler.

This order matters.

• Issue: What is the business challenge the client faces?

• Outcome: What does meaningful progress look like?

• Tool: How can technology support that progress?

We see that the strongest software and implementation providers are adopting this model. Not just in messaging but in how they design, price, and deliver their services.

## Why This Shift Is Hard. And Worth It

We recognise that this isn’t an easy pivot. Software and implementation businesses are often founded on extensive product expertise. Sales enablement, technical teams, and service models are all centred around software or platforms.

But the service opportunity is elsewhere. Clients don’t want a simple walkthrough of features. They seek assistance in overcoming the real obstacles in their environment.

The shift frombeing a tool expertto aproblem solverisn’t superficial. It alters how services are designed and delivered and opens up a very different kind of client relationship.

## Where Software and Implementation Providers Can Win

From our vantage point, here’s what works:

• Design services around client problems, not just platform usage.

• Train teams to start with diagnosis. Ask better questions before jumping to a technological solution.

• Speak the client’s business language. Don’t assume the buyer is fluent in your software features.

• Position technology as the means, not the end. Show progress before pitching the platform.

These shifts elevate the services conversation. They make it easier to engage earlier, land larger deals, and stay involved longer.

## Final Thought: Real Change Doesn’t Start With the Tool

Clients remember the impact, not the feature list.

The software solutions and implementation providers that grow most effectively aren’t just selling software; they’re designing services that eliminate real business friction. That’s what builds trust, enhances reputation, and creates long-term opportunities.

So here’s the invitation: Lead with the issue. Define the desired outcome. Allow the tool to be introduced at the right moment, not as the starting point.

Issue. Outcome. Tool.

That’s the order that wins.

# [Case Study] Moving From a Generic to a Specific Consulting Value Proposition

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 29 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/moving-from-a-generic-to-a-specific-consulting-value-proposition

---

## Data & Analytics Consulting Firm

## Executive Summary

A generic data and analytics consulting firm transitioned from offering generic services to specialising in improving supermarket operations over a two-year period. They followed our four-sprint approach, focusing on strategic alignment, value proposition design (starting with sales forecasting), client success journey design, and commercial enablement.

This phased approach involved testing and validating a new value proposition before a complete rebrand. The firm successfully increased deal size, established long-term contracts, reduced client acquisition costs, and achieved scalable, journey-based growth by specialising and focusing on specific contextual client needs.

## Chapter 1: Client Background and Context

The firm began as a typical Q1 data and analytics consultancy, offering generic services such as data integration, data cleaning, data visualisation, business intelligence solutions, etc., to various industries and client profiles.

However, four years after founding, they recognised that their undifferentiated Q1 position and value proposition risked further commoditisation and intense price competition. This was driven by the fierce battle against the Big 4 and brutal competition from contractors, freelancers, and other similar boutique consulting firms.

They aspired to develop a narrower and more specific focus to differentiate themselves and capture premium pricing, solving high-stake business issues in a much more targeted market.

At the start of the project, the decision to specialise in a specific client segment had not yet been made. The consultancy had the strong ambition to evolve into a Q4 player, a consulting firm known for its specialised expertise in a clearly defined market. Still, it had not yet determined the precise market or client focus.

That's where we came in. The consulting firm asked for our support to help identify the most promising specialisation path, assess their existing strengths, design a differentiating consulting value proposition, co-create a client success journey that would define their differentiation in the market, map their services on the client journey, and help them set up their future business development approach – all without risking the immediate erosion of the existing data & analytics revenue/clients.

We call this ‘the fade-in the new and fade-out the old approach’. Ultimately, they sought to eliminate the generic data and analytics profile step by step. After completing our project work in the first three months, they aimed to complete the entire consulting firm transformation and build the entire client success journey within approximately two years.

*Recommended reading:The Consulting Value Proposition Quadrant*

## Chapter 2: Our Approach – The 4 Sprints

Our approach consisted of four tightly connected sprints during 12 weeks, each building toward a sharper, outcome-led proposition, a scalable service architecture, and a more effective commercial engine. Here’s what we did:

### Sprint 1: Strategic Alignment & Commercial Foundations

In this first phase, we aligned the firm’s leadership around a new growth strategy, identified the most impactful past engagements (our ‘Best Engagements Review’), and set the direction for their future market positioning. This was crucial for understanding what had already worked and where their future specialisation could create the most significant impact.

The best engagement review promptly highlighted potential directions for their future proposition, aligning with their ambitions. Much of their best work occurred in Q3 (retail industry focus) and Q2 (sales forecasting specialisation), with the highest previous revenue coming from the supermarket sector (Q3 quadrant).

### Sprint 2: Value Proposition Design

Reviewing and discussing options in this sprint, the team narrowed the proposition down to helping retail companies improve operations. We co-created a clear, differentiated consulting value proposition anchored in real client issues that would form the backbone of their Q4 journey.

This included defining the key business issues to solve, for whom, and why they matter, ensuring their message would resonate in a competitive market. They decided to first focus on building the Sales Forecasting Improvement for Supermarkets proposition, testing and validating it, and then start building additional services within a client success journey concept, as created in the next sprint.

### Sprint 3: Client Success Journey Design

Once the initial value proposition (Sales Forecasting) was defined, we connected it to a practical client success journey. We mapped the stages in which clients could realise value, from initial conversations to profound, long-term transformation.

This included mapping their service offerings onto the client journey, ensuring each stage had clear, outcome-focused services aligned with their target market's specific needs and pain points. This journey design helped to identify trust-building entry points, natural expansion paths, and the critical role of service design in delivering on their promise.

*Recommended reading:Why Consulting Value Propositions Must Include a Client Success Journey*

### Sprint 4: Commercial Enablement

Finally, we equipped the team with the tools, structure, and initial key actions needed to test, validate, and sell their new proposition confidently. This included developing a go-to-market strategy to support long-term commercial success, business development playbooks and templates for core collateral (such as the website, social media, and pitch deck), and a small yet practical program that the firm could run to validate its initial value proposition (Sales Forecasting) while creating market visibility.

## Chapter 3: Our Role – Co-Creating the New Consulting Value Proposition in 2 Phases

In collaboration with our team, the consultancy undertook a comprehensive repositioning project that included:

• Intensive business deep dive and client segmentation analysis based on their past ‘best client engagements’ and future ambitions

• Co-creation of a new consulting value proposition in 2 phases:Phase 1: focus on sales forecasting improvements for supermarkets, targeting three core business issues/challenges (see the visual below)Phase 2: building the client success journey beyond sales forecasting (see visual #2)(Phase 3: (not yet started) targeting adjacent industries, such as fashion retail & e-commerce)

• Phase 1: focus on sales forecasting improvements for supermarkets, targeting three core business issues/challenges (see the visual below)

• Phase 2: building the client success journey beyond sales forecasting (see visual #2)

• (Phase 3: (not yet started) targeting adjacent industries, such as fashion retail & e-commerce)

## Chapter 4: Milestone-Based Success Journey

Expanding upon the firm’s newly-focused proposition (starting with Sales Forecasting Improvements), we co-created a journey featuring three core milestones:

### Milestone 1: Discovery and Direction Setting

• Services: Data Feasibility Study, Data Quality Assessment, Data Integration & Cleaning Program, and Readiness Assessment & Transformation Roadmap

• Focus: Establishing a clear strategic direction grounded in current data capabilities and business objectives.

• Outcome: Aligned stakeholders, realistic expectations, and a practical roadmap to guide the transformation journey.

### Milestone 2: Foundational Forecasting and Inventory Optimisation

• Services: Sales Forecasting (the initial proposition), Store Inventory Management

• Focus: Building a strong data foundation for precise demand planning and inventory management.

• Outcome: Reduced stockouts, lower carrying costs, and fewer markdowns.

### Milestone 3: Customer-Centric Strategy Development

• Services: Shopper Segmentation, Pricing Optimisation

• Focus: Developing customer-centric strategies to improve customer experience and profitability.

• Outcome: Higher customer retention, better pricing margins, and more personalised marketing.

### Milestone 4: Store Performance and Risk Control

• Services: Store Layout Optimisation, Fraud and Theft Detection Analytics

• Focus: Using integrated data to optimise physical store performance and reduce operational risks.

• Outcome: Lower loss rates, improved sales per square foot, better customer experience.

Defining this client success journey had two goals:

• Designing the client-facing services

• Developing the firm’s internal capabilities. This included building the expertise, use cases, and operational capacity to deliver on the three milestones. In practice, this meant that as they defined each stage of the client journey, they were simultaneously developing their internal capacity to support these stages, from data modelling for sales forecasting to more complex analytics, e.g. pricing and risk management.

Importantly, this development journey was carefully phased. They started immediately with the services linked to Milestones 1 and 2, as their Best Engagement Review confirmed they already had a solid foundation and expertise in these expertise domains. This allowed them to quickly gain momentum and confidence while building the more advanced capabilities required for the later stages of the journey.

## Chapter 5: The Go-to-market

We cannot disclose all the details of their GTM, but the most important takeaway of the project is the phased GTM approach (see also Chapter 3):

• Phase 1: The GTM for the new consulting value proposition ‘Sales Forecasting Improvements for Supermarkets’ was executed ‘at the campaign level’. This means that the core identity of the consulting firm remained 90% unchanged. Still, the homepage got a reference to the new Sales Forecasting value proposition (leading to a dedicated campaign landing page). The idea was twofold: 1) testing & validating the new value proposition, and 2) careful management of the existing (generic analytics) clients.

• Phase 2: The consulting firm's new identity was launched, with a full-blown GTM, launch campaign, client event, new homepage, etc. Existing (generic analytics) clients were informed step by step of the new focus and the future fade-out of generic analytical services.

## Chapter 6: Results and Impact

Over nearly two years, the consultancy transitioned from a generic data and analytics provider to a highly specialised firm with a sharp, differentiating value proposition built around a structured client success journey. The laser-sharp focus on supermarkets allowed them to achieve four key results:

• Significantly increase their average deal size.

• Create multi-year contracts and long-term client relationships (including a managed service agreement).

• Reduce client acquisition costs by focusing on journey-based upselling and deeper client relationships.

• Move from headcount-dependent growth as a generic data & analytics firm to journey-based scalability.

## Chapter 7: Lessons Learned

The consultancy’s journey highlights the value of intentional proposition design and narrow focus over opportunistic growth. It demonstrates the power of deeply understanding a specific client segment, building a differentiating value proposition, and a structured client success journey.

Aligning services to each of the four strategic milestones provided a clear path for delivering measurable client value. This shift has already increased profitability and created a more resilient business model with recurring revenue streams.

As we always say, they transformed the consulting firm from a “We do X” (generic data and analytics) positioning to “We solve X” (improving supermarket operational performance).

# [Case Study] Why Offering Too Many Services Destroyed This Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 26 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-offering-too-many-services-destroyed-this-boutique-consultancy

---

Here’s the story of the collapse of a 25-person boutique consultancy that was biting off more than it could chew (a true story, anonymised to maintain confidentiality).In early 2022, I was engaged to assist a boutique consultancy in enhancing its consulting proposition and overall performance.While I won't delve into every nuance, their primary challenge stemmed from offering a wide array of services (five distinct service offerings), even though they all fell under a single domain expertise 'umbrella'.My perspective? With a lean team of just 25 individuals, making five distinct, pretty much unrelated services stand out in a competitive marketplace is an uphill battle. Why is this the case?That's the intriguing subject I'll explore in this article.

## Why over-diversified boutique consultancies are doomed to struggle

At the onset of our collaboration, I thoroughly examined their service offerings, along with the consultancy's performance data. My findings were revealing.Of the five services they offered, they aimed to cater to four distinct buyer profiles, each characterised by unique needs, contexts, pain points, and budget considerations.Alarmingly, four of these services hadn't achieved market fit. In essence, they hadn't been sufficiently tested across multiple projects to ensure they met the specific needs and challenges of their target audience.While these services were conceptualised on paper (and with the help of a few initial small projects) and led by five dedicated service leaders (a significant portion of their team and overhead cost), tangible evidence of market fit (and deep buyer understanding) was glaringly absent.This disconnect resulted in limited market traction and revenue growth.

Lacking a compelling value proposition that connected with their target audience, these services found it difficult to build a strong presence, leading to wasted resources (not interchangeable between the services due to different areas of expertise), missed opportunities, and lower ROI.In a fiercely competitive environment, neglecting to align offerings with the unique needs of each buyer segment can be the difference between thriving and fading into irrelevance.Many of our intense discussions, where I pointed out the pitfalls of a small team covering a wide range of services, often returned to their firm (and naive - sorry to say) belief: “A broad service range is essential to stay competitive in the market.”My answer: “You can never achieve market fit and decent consultancy performance (revenue, project margins, overall profit, expertise reputation) with five immature services and a lean team of 20 persons.”

*Recommended reading:Evaluating and Improving Performance of the Founder-Led Boutique Consultancy*

## A new service takes two years to mature

What? Two years? Kidding me, Luk?That’s how people often react when discussing maturing a new consultancy service.A new consulting service targeting a different or new buyer profile, focusing on specific needs or pain points (as in this article's consultancy), typically takes around two years to mature. It can go slightly faster if targeting the same buyer profile with an adjacent service.Not everybody agrees with my vision of maturing a new consultancy service.But here's the thing: introducing a new service goes much further than just conceptualisation and launching. It's a complex journey that starts with understanding the intricacies of the target market and customer.1. Understanding the Target BuyerThis includes both macro and microelements. It’s essential to define the profile of the target buyer and to clearly identify the pain points and challenges they encounter, along with the specific circumstances that intensify these issues.

Recognising what triggers a potential buyer to actively seek consulting support—such as organisational change, declining performance, market disruption, regulatory shifts, or internal skill gaps (to name a few)—is vital.

Budget also plays a crucial role, as prospective clients will have varying expectations and constraints regarding how much they are willing or able to invest in consulting services. Understanding the budget landscape—not just what clients can pay, but how spending decisions are made internally—is indispensable for shaping viable offerings and setting realistic expectations.

Importantly, achieving this depth of insight into buyers’ needs, triggers, and budget realities is not something that happens overnight. It is a process that demands repeated interaction, careful listening, and ongoing refinement, often taking substantial time, contributing to the typical two-year period needed for the service to truly mature and achieve market fit.

All these insights together lay the groundwork for developing a compelling and relevant consulting value proposition.

2. Project Repetition and Pattern RecognitionAs the service is repeatedly delivered, the team begins to recognise patterns. This repetition enables the fine-tuning of methodologies and approaches, ensuring that common challenges are addressed more efficiently with each subsequent project. Over time, this pattern recognition becomes a valuable asset, enabling quicker problem-solving and more effective service delivery.

Just as a researcher discerns patterns in data, a medical specialist diagnoses conditions based on symptomatic patterns, or a scientist makes discoveries through repeated experimentation, a consultancy derives a differentiating consulting proposition by undertaking similar projects repeatedly.

3. Data Gathering, Benchmarking, and Continuous ImprovementWith every project undertaken, there’s an invaluable opportunity not only to gather data and establish benchmarks, but also to leverage project repetition as a source of continuous improvement.

Delivering similar types of projects repeatedly enables the team to identify patterns, refine processes, and build robust methodologies, all of which contribute to becoming more effective and efficient with each engagement.

The principle is straightforward: the more projects executed, the larger the pool of data and lessons learned, and the better the consultancy can project and manage future outcomes.

Over time, the accumulation of project data and repeated delivery significantly reduces the variability of results, enabling more predictable and evidence-based success.

This ongoing cycle of repetition and data gathering not only demonstrates the effectiveness of the service but also positions the consultancy as a credible thought leader that can offer clients tangible and increasingly reliable metrics on success, further strengthening its value proposition.

4. Client Wins and Reputation BuildingMaturing a new service is a gradual, demanding process that requires a lot of work and patience. Each client win is not just an achievement, but a critical building block for the service’s development. Every engagement helps refine the methodology, improve consistency, and deepen understanding of what works (and what doesn’t) across different client situations.It’s through this hands-on effort and real-world learning that the service truly evolves. Lessons from each project—both successes and setbacks—feed into strengthening the offer and building its reputation for reliability and impact. Over time, these cumulative experiences move the service from being “new and unproven” to genuinely mature and trusted by clients.

5. Financial Performance and ProfitabilityA true marker of a service's maturity is its financial performance. For me, achieving a margin of at least 40% is essential. As the service is refined and its reputation builds, there is potential for this margin to grow. A well-established, in-demand service should aim for a margin over 50%, ensuring the consultancy's long-term profitability and sustainability.

#### Yes, it takes two years to mature

Reflecting on the story of my former client, their ambitious attempt to juggle five services with a modest team of 25 underscores the challenges.

From my experience, it takes at least two years of dedicated effort—repeated delivery, ongoing learning, and constant refinement—for even a single service to reach genuine maturity and success.

The boutique consultancy’s struggle demonstrates just how much sustained work is involved. Only after this foundational period, when a service has been thoroughly tested, improved, and proven its value in the market, would I recommend even considering the cautious launch of another (adjacent) service.

Rushing this process or skipping key steps only leads to diluted focus and the same pitfalls seen in this case study.

## A boutique consultancy is not a Big 4 consulting firm

Unlike large consulting firms, boutique consultancies do not have the resources and the manpower to diversify their service offering heavily.It’s one thing if a Deloitte or KPMG-type international consultancy with offices worldwide and thousands of consultants decides to offer a new service. These large companies always have excess capacity to make the new service practice stand on its feet.Boutique consultancies don’t. And they don’t need to. We (iNostix - acquired by Deloitte) were able to beat the MBBs (McK, BCG, Bain,...) and Big 4 consultancies in pitches multiple times, driven by our deep expertise and market reputation.A consultancy of 20-25 people will never be able to compete against the industry giantson the variety of services it offers. Or even medium-sized firms of 100-200 people. That’s a losing battle from the start.

• The depth of expertise that can be gained across many service areas will never be enough to be regarded as the go-to experts.

• The non-billable hours and overhead will always be disproportionately high, as in the case of my client with five service offering leaders, when attempting to market multiple service lines: client onboarding costs (the number of hours the consultants must invest), marketing and business development expenses, scattered data collection, high variability in procedures and systems that often need to be customised for each client, and so on.Moreover, the challenges of managing and onboarding diverse client projects, communications, contractual details, training needs, and quality assurance for each service quickly become overwhelming.

• The ROI of marketing and business development efforts will always be inefficient. Why? Instead of focusing all its marketing efforts on a single service area for a highly specific audience, the boutique consultancy in this case study spreads its efforts across multiple areas and a broader audience.

• Clients will always prefer to hire a consultancy with years of experience and a proven track record of delivering high-impact results in a narrow field. Variation in the service offering is undermining the predictability of outcomes. And clients want outcomes!

• There is a lack of thought leadership and a strong reputational footprint to consistently generate leads and capture the attention of prospects. This was the foundation of our success (iNostix) for nearly a decade.

There are many reasons why boutique consultancies struggle to compete effectively in the market when they try to do too much for too many.I want these consultancies to realise that they don’t need to. Their greatest strength isn't in the number of services they offer, but in how knowledgeable and impactful they are with just one.

## In conclusion

It has been nearly three years since I was engaged to audit the consultancy in this case study and advise them on the best course of action. I am saddened to learn that this boutique consultancy is in serious trouble as I write this article.

They have lost several service-offering leaders due to low morale. Four out of five service offerings are severely underperforming.Unfortunately, I was unable to persuade the consultancy owners to abandon their diversification plans and instead concentrate solely on developing a single service offering into a high-profit product that garners strong market recognition before contemplating adding related services.Is it too late? It might be, but not necessarily. That’s why I urge boutique consultancies to reconsider their business models and stop their endless pursuit of variety in work and clients. Specificity and focus – that’s what enables small consultancies to attain extraordinary levels of success.

# Why Software Vendors Must Invest in Professional Services

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 22 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-software-vendors-must-invest-in-professional-services

---

Software vendors are still losing deals they should win, and failing to retain clients they could have kept. The reason is rarely the product. It’s the lack of aprofessional services function that’s intentionally built or properly designed to support adoption, outcomes, and client progress.

Some vendors don’t have one at all. Others have one in name, but not in impact. In both cases, the effect is the same: clients don’t get the results they expected, and vendors leave value on the table.

Most clients don’t struggle with tools. They struggle with complexity, broken processes, siloed systems, internal resistance, and underutilized platforms. Without a services function that tackles these issues head-on—grounded in a clear value proposition—even the most powerful software won’t deliver the expected results.

## The reality of enterprise software

Enterprise software is almost never ready to deliver immediate impact and value. It needs to be configured, integrated, adopted, and embedded in the business or organization. That work is often the difference between failure and success.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

• Complex system environments with hundreds of legacy tools

• Custom processes that require tailored integrations

• Risk and compliance requirements that slow down deployments

• Users who are untrained or unmotivated to adopt new tools

• Change fatigue that derails even well-designed rollouts

Without expert support, enterprise software becomes shelfware. In many organisations, over 40% of purchased software licences are underused by employees. It's not due to the product being weak, but because a disciplined and well-managed implementation process was lacking.

A strong services function helps clients avoid this waste by translating the product into progress—anchored in a clear and outcome-specific value proposition.

## Change doesn’t happen without help

Implementation is only one part of the challenge. The bigger challenge is change. And change doesn’t happen by itself.

Professional services teams guide clients through the shift in mindset, workflow, and behaviour that any meaningful software deployment requires. When done well, this includes:

• Onboarding and training tailored to real-life use cases

• Redesign of broken processes or legacy ways of working

• Clear communication and stakeholder alignment

• Support from leadership to keep the transformation on track

The data is clear: projects with strong change management are seven times more likely to meet their goals. Without that support, tools are installed but never embedded.

## Clients don’t buy tools. They buy results.

Most clients don’t care which product gets used—as long as it solves their problem. When vendors lead with the product, they assume the client has already diagnosed the issue and mapped the solution. That’s rarely the case.

The stronger position is to lead with the problem:

• What is actually slowing down the business?

• What’s the cost of inaction?

• What outcome would create real momentum?

Only once those questions are answered should the tool come in. This is the model we promote in our work: Issue → Outcome → Tool.

That order matters. It moves the vendor from software seller to trusted advisor. It ensures the client’s actual problem is being solved. It also gives the services team a more strategic role, rather than a post-sale afterthought.

The foundation for this shift is a sharp value proposition—one that connects the software offering to the real business issues clients need to address. Without it, services will always stay reactive and commoditized.

## A smarter business model

(Re)investing in professional services—by building or improving the function—is not just good for the client. It’s a smart move for the vendor.

• Stickier clients. When products are deeply integrated, clients are much less likely to churn.

• Higher renewal rates. Adoption drives outcomes. Outcomes drive retention.

• New revenue streams. For every $1 spent on software, clients typically spend $5 to $10 on related services.

• Stronger sales cases. Clients want to know not just what the software does, but how they’ll succeed with it.

In some cases, professional services can even be used as a strategic lever: offered at low or no margin to accelerate product adoption and lifetime value.

## Build or improve, with intention

Whether building a new professional services function or improving an existing one, the goal is the same: to translate software into results. But that requires a services engine designed with intention, not as an afterthought.

• Starting every engagement with a proper diagnostic

• Designing tiered service offerings (quick start, high touch, outcome-led)

• Offering pricing models that reflect value, not effort

• Training consultants in business impact, not just technical setup

• Equipping partners with the same standards and frameworks

• Anchoring all of it in a value proposition that makes the client’s business case obvious

A services function without a strong value proposition is just another delivery team. A services function with a clear value proposition becomes a growth engine.

## Final thought

Software doesn’t deliver value on its own. People do. Process does. Integration does. And behind all of that, there needs to be a clear, outcome-specific value proposition that guides what the services function is actually there to do.

If a vendor wants to win larger deals, retain clients longer, and deliver tangible business outcomes, a professional services function—built or enhanced around a compelling value proposition—is not optional. It’s essential.

In today’s enterprise market, clients don’t buy software. They buy progress.And it’s the value proposition behind the service function that turns technology into traction.

# Why Sales Training Won’t Fix Consulting Firms’ Sales Problem

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 15 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-sales-training-wont-fix-consulting-firms-sales-problem

---

“We just need more of our people to sell.” We hear this a lot in our daily work with consulting firms.

Typically, this comes up in conversations with firms where a couple of rainmakers carry most of the business development burden. And then, someone suggests: “Let’s do some sales training.”

This is a common instinct in consultancies – not limited to our clients and prospects. According to theConsultancy BenchPress reportfrom 2025, 75% of UK consulting firms are planning to invest in “sales capabilities” this year.

And we almost always say: Not yet.

Sales training tends to focus on the process: conversation frameworks, buyer personas, negotiation steps. These are all useful elements but only if the team already knows what they’re selling.

And in most consultancies, the people just don't. Not because they’re unskilled, but because the firm itself hasn’t clarified its propositions.

And sales will always remain an uphill battle (read: a time and money drain) for consulting firms that don’t have a crystal-clear value proposition.

The above-mentioned report has found that only 17% of firm owners think their firm's proposition is very differentiated. This means that of those 75% investing in "sales capabilities," a full 80% won't get their money's worth in return.

Here, we dive into why clarity and differentiation of the value proposition – not training – should come first.

## A Strong Sales Culture Requires A Strong Value Proposition Foundation

In our work with consulting firms, we’ve found that value proposition design is too often treated like a messaging tweak. A new headline. A better pitch.

However, real consulting value proposition design reshapes everything. It defines who the firm serves, what problems it solves, how it delivers impact, and why it exists at all.

It crystallizes – both internally and externally – answers to questions like:

• What business issue(s) do we solve?

• For which clients?

• What do they usually struggle with?

• What do we transform – and how differentiated do we deliver?

• What outcomes do we achieve?

• What is the typical client success journey or roadmap?

These are all critical "content" pieces and without clear answers, every sales conversation becomes guesswork.

The result? Only those with the instincts to be great guessers – natural improvisers, intuitive communicators – can succeed.

And, unfortunately, that success is relative: without a strict adherence to the parameters defined by the value proposition, the rainmakers ultimately lead consulting firms to a downstream vortex.

They come back from a client proudly asking, "Guess what I've sold to them?!?" More often than not, it’s something new, something improvised.

The delivery becomes a patchwork of improvised processes. Efficiency takes a hit. Resources – including talent – are not utilized optimally. The pipeline of work becomes spotty at best. Referral work dwindles, and case studies fail to show excellence in any particular niche.

That’s why we always recommend that consulting firms start with designing the consulting value proposition. We encourage firms to first clarify the issues they address, the outcomes they deliver, and the delivery method they use to get there. Then to share and reinforce this playbook internally.

*Recommended reading:The Ultimate Guide to Consulting Value Proposition Design*

When this foundation is in place, everything else becomes easier and more consistent.

Business development becomes less about persuading prospects to buy something and more about finding the right fit. Sales conversations gain focus and confidence. Delivery teams know exactly what promises are being made and how to fulfill them. Marketing becomes targeted and more impactful.

And over time, the consulting firm builds and strengthens a reputation for its ability to deliver substantial transformations.

Only once it becomes crystal clear what a consultancy transforms, how it does it, who it helps, and what problems it solves will a sales training (typically covering areas like opportunity qualification, objection handling, negotiation steps, sales funnels, and closing techniques) actually deliver the intended results.

## How a Value Proposition Unlocks the Collective Sales Capacity

In high-performing consulting firms, sales success is often a byproduct. It’s not what a few leaders do on top of their work. It’s a side effect of the consultancy doing other things extremely well.

Yes, most are used to thinking of sales as a separate function. But when a consulting firm has a differentiating value proposition and it consistently delivers what it promises, sales stops being about pitching and persuading.

Rather, it becomes a conversation about fit – whether a client’s challenges align with the consultancy’s expertise.

Sales also stops being the responsibility of just a select few within the business. Value proposition design unlocks what we call a “collective sales capacity” – an environment where everyone can explain what the consulting firm solves and why it matters.

This collective sales capacity doesn’t just elevate traditional client-facing roles. It also empowers and leverages experts with deep expertise in client-facing situations – individuals who are often overlooked because leadership assumes they lack the communication skills to engage directly with clients.

A strong value proposition helps these experts frame what they know and do in C-suite contexts and language. It helps them clearly articulate how their expertise connects to client outcomes, which, in turn, allows them to participate meaningfully in pitches and client discussions.

As a result, the consulting firm is able to tap into its entire pool of talent, further boosting trust with prospects.

Ultimately, unlocking collective sales capacity transforms the trajectory of growth in a consulting firm.

It builds a culture where every team member-owners, team leaders, consultants, marketers, technical specialists, etc., shares ownership of the firm’s messaging and actively contributes to growth. This alignment creates consistency in client engagements, strengthens the consultancy’s reputation, and drives sustainable growth.

*Recommended reading:How Thought Leadership Has Been Driving My Business Development for 15+ Years*

## Foundations First

When a consulting firm depends on a handful of rainmakers, no amount of sales training will fundamentally change how it grows. Real transformation starts with clarity – clarity about what the firm does, how it does it, and for whom.

A well-defined value proposition doesn’t just make sales easier; it turns every conversation into a confident exploration of fit, not a desperate attempt to persuade. It unlocks the consultancy’s collective sales capacity, enabling the whole team to contribute to growth.

That’s why it’s so striking that while 75% of consulting firms plan to invest in “sales capabilities” this year, only 17% of firm owners believe their proposition is truly differentiated. In other words, most are about to train their teams to sell something they themselves aren’t clear about.

So before committing to another round of sales training, it’s worth asking: “Is our value proposition clear enough that everyone in our firm can confidently explain why we matter?”

Because until that answer is yes, sales will always feel like a guessing game, and an expensive one at that.

# Hiring a Business Development Leader Will Not Fix Boutique Consultancies’ Growth Problems

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 12 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/hiring-a-business-development-leader-will-not-fix-boutique-consultancies-growth-problems

---

Many boutique consultancies see hiring a new business development (BD) leader as the ultimate solution for driving growth.

The idea is simple: hire a seasoned professional to open doors, attract high-quality clients, and revitalize the sales pipeline quickly. But in my experience, this approach often backfires.

I often observed that within 12 to 24 months, these consultancies find themselves disillusioned, watching their ambitious growth plans fizzle out.

In this article, I’ll explain why newly appointed BD leaders frequently struggle to meet expectations and what foundational steps consultancies can take to prepare them for lasting success.

## Why business development leaders often fail in boutique consultancies

While BD leaders are expected to attract new clients, develop existing accounts, and magically transform the business, they’re often set up to fail from day one.After watching this pattern repeat over the years, here’s what I—and my network—have witnessed consistently go wrong.

• Unclear consultancy proposition: If the firm’s value proposition isn’t defined, the BD leader will not know what to sell, who to sell to, and how to identify opportunities. This leads to failed deals and frustration.

• No relevant consultancy experience and subject matter expertise: Without consulting experience, the BD leader might struggle with the challenges or nuances of the business. This lack of credibility hurts trust with clients and internal teams.

• Poor expertise reputation: If the consultancy doesn’t have a solid reputation as an expert, selling becomes an uphill battle. Building credibility as a consultancy takes time, but BD leaders don’t get that much time. They are typically under pressure to deliver instant results.

• Junior or generic marketing support: Inexperienced marketing teams hurt the ability to build trust at scale. ‘Doing a bit of social media’ won’t get the new BD leader there. It becomes a waste of time for everyone involved, and the messaging often gets further diluted.

• Lack of leadership support: BD leaders are often thrown in at the deep end. Boutique consultancy owners hire a BD person, provide basic training on services and operations, and then abdicate the responsibility.

• Lack of internal alignment: On the other end of the spectrum are multiple consultancy leaders/owners pulling their BD leader in different directions. When priorities change daily, it’s close to impossible to achieve measurable results.

• Inadequate resources: Hiring BD leaders from established firms only to hang them out to dry by failing to provide them with the systems, processes, and human resources they need is a surefire way to end up with disappointing results.

• Focus on new clients only: Ignoring existing clients limits growth. Retaining and developing current accounts is the real value; missing it means missed revenue and opportunities for high-margin work. Unfortunately, BD leaders rarely get involved—or are allowed to get involved—in managing and expanding existing clients.

• Outbound focus: Relying on cold outbound efforts – calls, emails, paid ads, etc. – creates inconsistent results. Consultancy sales are built on trust, credibility, and proven expertise, not hard selling. It’s a relationship-driven business where clients invest in expertise to solve complex problems, not just buy a product off the shelf. Cold outreach lacks the credibility needed to build that trust and often comes across as desperate or transactional, which turns potential clients off (and can erode the expertise's reputation).

• Disconnected from the client experience: Without firsthand experience in the consulting workflow or direct client interactions, BD leaders risk misrepresenting the consultancy’s offerings, overpromising results, or failing to convey the value. This results in dissatisfaction or mismatched expectations, harming client retention.

• Short-term pressure for results: Pressuring for quick wins leads to transactional sales, which hurts client trust and creates high churn, damaging long-term growth.

• Over-reliance on the BD leader: When the consultancy relies solely on the BD leader to drive sales, it creates a bottleneck. Sales should be a team effort, not just one person carrying the entire load.

• Inadequate data: Many boutique consultancies lack data-driven insights into client acquisition costs, conversion rates, and other KPIs. Without a solid analytics foundation, BD leaders can only rely on intuition.

## How to set up the right environment for a BD leader to succeed

While I’ve seen many BD leaders crash and burn due to a mix of the reasons I’ve listed earlier, I’ve also seen cases where they were able to deliver outstanding results.

Having a dedicated business development specialist is not a mistake by default. What I urge boutique consultancies to do, though, is first to set up the right conditions—systems, processes, and approaches—for this person to thrive.Below are the success factors that I recommend owners and senior leaders aim to accomplish first:

• Designing a precise, powerful proposition: If a BD leader doesn’t know what to sell, that’s a big problem. Senior leadership within boutique consultancies needs to fix it. This will be at the foundation of everything a BD leader does: who they reach out to, how they go about it, what type of messaging they prioritise, the value-driven pitch of services, and so on.

• Ensuring internal alignment: It’s crucial that a BD leader feels empowered. This is only possible when the entire senior leadership has this person’s back, and the leadership team is aligned around the goals and priorities.

• Hiring from the trenches: If BD leaders don't have rich consultancy experience, they are set up to fail. I recommend either appointing someone to this role from within or, if hiring from outside, looking for someone with relevant subject matter expertise and a BD drive or someone with experience in the BD role in consultancies.

• Calibrating and strengthening market reputation: Taking credibility takes time, yes, but there is no way around it. Gone are the days of cold-calling strategies delivering meaningful impact. Prospects want to trust their partners. And for that, they need to consider the consultancy as the expert in resolving particular needs.

• Investing in real marketing: Junior support means junior results. I strongly encourage boutique consultancies to think through their marketing strategy, hire experienced marketers, and foster a culture where everyone – from junior consultants to owners – contributes to marketing efforts.

• Prioritising current clients: Expanding existing accounts is the fastest way to achieve revenue stability and business growth. Instead of chasing new prospects, I suggest that boutique consultancies look inward and identify opportunities to build on their existing relationships. Not only will this help generate recurring revenue, but it will also offer consultancies a deeper understanding of the market’s needs. It will create a blueprint for BD leaders when looking to recruit long-term clients.

• Setting up support mechanisms and allocating sufficient resources: If a boutique consultancy can’t afford to allocate adequate resources towards the success of a BD leader (tech, support staff, training, etc.), then it can’t afford to hire a BD leader. It will just be months of wasted effort and money.

• Building sustainable, scalable journeys: I implore boutique consultancies to stop the cold outbound madness. I'm sorry to say that cold outbound BD in consulting is inefficient. Instead, I recommend building client success journeys that entice prospects, offer a low-risk entry service, and facilitate continuous trust-building. Inbound channels will allow BD leaders to be exponentially more effective in recruiting ideal clients.

• Making sales a collective effort: Counting on a BD leader to do all the selling is a weak strategy. Sales should be a collective effort, not a one-person show. Of course, not everyone can sell to the same degree of success – or allocate the same amount of time. However, growing the consultancy’s reputation for high-value expertise, engaging in conversations with prospects, and presenting unified messaging – these elements should be a part of the culture of a boutique consultancy.

• Thinking long-term: Pressuring for quick results destroys long-term growth and motivation. There are no quick wins when building a sustainable growth mechanism. For example, audience education-based marketing and business development take time to set up and propagate. However, the long-term results that boutique consultancies can derive are massive. Such strategies might be laborious at first, but they allow consultancies to decrease client acquisition costs in the long run continuously!

• Being diligent about data collection: BD leaders are more likely to succeed if they make data-driven decisions: who is more likely to buy when.

## In conclusion

Hiring a business development leader is not a silver bullet for driving growth in boutique consultancies. While certainly an important role to fill for a business's growth, consultancies must actively take steps and measures to prepare these people for success.Furthermore, to minimise the risk of failure, I urge boutique consultancies to build a growth-driven culture where client acquisition is a collective effort instead of putting all hopes and dreams in a single BD person. This involves crafting a solid market reputation, aligning all team members around shared goals, and continuously developing existing client relationships.Boutique consultancies can achieve more resilient and sustainable growth by recognizing that business development is not a one-person job but a collaborative, strategic effort.

# The Value Proposition Gap: What Consulting Firms Say vs. What Clients Hear

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 01 July 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-value-proposition-gap-in-consulting

---

Most consulting firms operate with weak or generic consulting propositions. There is no clarity, true differentiation, or relevance to real client pain points.

In our experience, consultancies with weak consulting propositions tend to fall into one of three categories:

• Indifference: Some consulting firms simply don’t care. They don’t believe that investing time and effort into sharpening or completely changing the value proposition will yield any meaningful results. They slapped a tagline-type of messaging on their website and believe it suffices.

• Stuck in value proposition limbo: These consulting firms know their value proposition isn’t working, but they don’t know how to fix it. Perhaps they’ve outgrown their original positioning. In many cases, it was never that strong to begin with. They sense the disconnect, but the risk of getting it wrong feels too high.

• Blind spots and the internal echo chamber: Many firms are simply unaware of just how weak their positioning is. They have convinced themselves that their value proposition resonates, often because it sounds good internally or has been in use for years. Often, these blind spots are reinforced by positive feedback from loyal clients who already “get it.” But to new prospects, the ones you actually need to convince, the message doesn’t land.

Here is what all three groups have in most instances: what they call a “value proposition” is just a description of what they do. It’s a laundry list of capabilities and services.

“We are experts in X and here are our services” may sound impressive internally. It emphasises the firm’s expertise, capabilities, and scope of work. However, it means nothing to the outside world, especially not to new prospects. Clients are not searching for services; they are seeking solutions to their problems, and they want them delivered with maximum effectiveness and minimum risk.

And that is where the disconnect lies between internal and external perceptions of value propositions, which I wish to discuss in this article.

## How Clients Experience Value and the Dangerous Disconnect

The “internal echo chamber” consulting firms believe they have a strong value proposition because they talk about results, expertise, or capabilities:

• “We help our clients succeed with digital transformation”

• “We reduce your cost base”

• “We optimise your supply chain”.

They are confident in their value proposition because they (seem to) promise a result or outcome. What they often fail to understand or acknowledge is that this is simply a promise. It’s not a proven problem-to-resolution path.

Consequently, such propositions often fail during the initial client meeting. They appear generic and “we-centric,” reflecting an inside-out perspective. The more a firm discusses what it does, the greater the risk of sounding like every other firm.

Clients often don’t experience proven value during the project scope or in the slide decks. They can only experience it by having the following questions answered:

• Clarity about the problem: Does this consulting firm grasp the full extent of the client problem? Can it diagnose and fix it with surgeon-like precision?

• Confidence in resolution: Does this consultancy have a proven problem-to-resolution path that has been tested multiple times in the past? How confident are we in the consultancy’s ability to actually execute this path?

• Tangible business impact: Will solving this problem make a measurable difference to the business? Will it reduce risk, significantly reduce costs, or improve performance in a way that can be seen and felt on the bottom line?

• Emotional reassurance: Do we trust this consulting firm and its team members? Do they make us feel understood, or is this just a facade of a sales pitch? Will they bring confidence and clarity to a complex situation or just add to the complexity?

## Symptoms of a Misaligned Value Proposition

There are numerous symptoms of the core issue: a misalignment between the prospects’ perception of the consulting proposition and the consultancy’s internal view of its strength.

These symptoms show up across various dimensions:

#### Targeting & Positioning

• Inbound leads are off-target

• Firms win work outside their sweet spot and lose work they’re well-suited for

• Business development relies heavily on individual relationships or founder reputation

Underlying cause: the consultancy is selling broad capabilities rather than a clearly defined transformation. The positioning is reactive and inconsistent.

#### Consulting Proposition

• Prospects frequently ask, “So what do you actually do?”

• Referrals reflect outdated or misaligned messaging

• The firm’s offer is explained differently in every conversation

• Outcome discussions are avoided because they are difficult to define

Underlying cause: the value proposition is vague or overly “we-focused”. It may sound compelling within the firm, but it lacks external clarity or relevance. It does not clearly convey the problem solved, who it's for, or how it leads to meaningful results.

#### Client Engagement

• Proposals get stuck in decision cycles without closure

• Clients disengage after an initial strong meeting

• Sales cycles are erratic and often longer than expected

Underlying cause: the value proposition doesn’t create confidence or clarity. Clients are not drawn into a compelling journey because the firm is pitching services instead of offering a clear path to resolution and impact.

#### Service Offering

• Teams frequently start from scratch on proposal decks

• Referrals are vague or unrelated to the firm’s core strengths

• Outcomes are difficult to define or anchor in conversations

Underlying cause: the service model is improvised or disconnected from high-stakes client challenges. Without a structured, repeatable offer that takes prospects on a client success journey, clients struggle to understand the value.

#### Delivery & Operations

• Frequent project scope creep

• Delivery approaches vary widely across projects

• Execution is inconsistent and inefficient

Underlying cause: the absence of a standardised delivery model leads to complexity, low repeatability, and operational strain. There is no clear link between the promise and the process.

#### Growth Model & Pipeline

• Business development is driven by a few key individuals

• Pipeline quality is unpredictable and lacks consistency

• Project work is short-term and fails to build toward strategic growth

Underlying cause: without a compelling transformation narrative and repeatable model, growth remains opportunistic. Consulting firms chase leads rather than systematically attracting the right-fit clients and developing and retaining them over an extended period.

#### Pricing

• Pricing pressure arises despite strong credentials

• Clients focus on cost rather than value

• Projects are scoped to budget rather than to impact

Underlying cause: selling capabilities positions the consultancy as a commodity. Without a differentiated problem-resolution path, pricing power is weak, and the value of transformation is unclear.

#### Talent & Team

• Talent is misaligned with the firm’s stated value proposition

• New hires introduce inconsistency instead of clarity

• Internal teams spend excessive time tailoring the pitch per client

Underlying cause: a vague or constantly shifting proposition makes it hard to build and maintain a team with shared expertise. Talent strategies are often reactive rather than aligned with strategic goals.

#### Trust & Risk

• Clients hesitate to commit even after a strong pitch

• Firms are asked to do unpaid exploratory work

• Larger firms (bigger brands) are perceived as safer bets

Underlying cause: without a proven, repeatable path to transformation, the consultancy is seen as a risk. The pitch may sound good, but the delivery model lacks the confidence-building structure clients look for.

*Recommended reading:Do Consulting Firms Know the Real Problems They Solve?*

## Bridging the Gap: From Describing Services to Delivering a Transformation

#### Step 1: Zeroing in On the Client Pain

It is imperative that consultancies switch the mindset from “we”-centric to client-centric. And at the foundation of that should be the client’s typical pain points.

I recommend that, instead of leading with services, consulting firms start by thinking about the client's high-stakes challenges and struggles.

These core pain points should be clearly defined, and the consequences of inaction strongly highlighted.

#### Step 2: Articulating the Desired Solution

I strongly encourage consulting firms to reconsider how they describe the end state that clients aim to achieve. It shouldn’t use buzzwords or technical jargon.

#### Step 3: Mapping Services to Outcomes

This is about reversing the order. Instead of giving a list of services and then expecting prospects to connect them to the desired outcomes, consulting firms first state the business outcome and then, only after it’s clear, connect it to the services: "Here's how these outcomes can be achieved with services X, Y, Z."

#### Step 4: Designing the Value Proposition

Inone of our most-read articles, we offer consulting firms a straightforward way to design a winning consulting proposition. I encourage consultancies to rethink and rearticulate their value proposition based on the following template:

• Our clients come to us because… (urgent problem)

• They typically are… (the ideal client profile)

• They struggle with… (specific pain)

• They can expect… (measurable outcome)

• Here’s how we help… (journey, roadmap, methodology)

#### Step 5: Testing the New Consulting Proposition

The fear of getting it wrong stops many consulting firms from redesigning their value proposition. However, I always emphasise that it doesn’t have to be perfect or permanent to get started. A redesign of such a foundational element requires testing and validation. So, I recommend starting small and using the new consulting proposition in actual meetings, iterating fast, and trying again, until hitting the sweet spot.

*Recommended reading:Building a Winning Consulting Value Proposition*

## Nobody Buys a Capability List – Time for Action

The gap between what consulting firms say and what clients interpret goes beyond mere messaging. It poses a strategic risk.

Consultancies that persist in leading with “We do X” or "We are experts in X"  risk becoming commoditised without even realising it. Top-performing consulting firms don’t just detail their services. They mention their list of services only as a last resort in client discussions.

Instead, they focus on a specific, high-stakes problem and demonstrate how they resolve it. They address the client's typical pain points, rather than vanity results ("We improve your X")or impressivecapabilities. Their approach centres on high-impact transformation, not just service offerings.

• From “We do X” to “We solve X”.

• From selling capabilities to offering transformations  (“Here's what you can achieve”).

• From listing the consulting firm's services to explaining the high-stakes scenarios or context where they deliver the most value.

• From promising vanity results to demonstrating a proven problem-to-resolution path.

It’s not always an easy change, but it can deliver a radical impact. To succeed, it demands the commitment to clarity, the courage to say no (much) more often, and a willingness to step outside the internal echo chamber.

# Do Consulting Firms Know the Real Problems They Solve?

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

## The High Cost of Focusing on Capabilities, Not Client Pain.

In our conversations with consulting leaders, one thing never fails to amaze me – how few consulting leaders can explain what business problem(s) their consulting firm solves.

Instead, in 95% of cases, they tell us what they do:

• “We help our clients with digital transformation.”

• “We help them find AI use cases.”

• “We specialise in customer excellence.”

Got it. Great. Except that is NOT explaining the business problem!

This sort of explanation forces prospective clients to connect the dots. It becomes the client’s responsibility to figure out how they can utilise a consultancy’s services. And very few clients have the time, energy, or interest to solve that puzzle.

That’s what I’d like to discuss in this article. I think of this question as a quick test, and the response often points to deeper problems within a consultancy.

## Confusing Capabilities With Business Problems

Here are three illustrations of the distinction between capabilities and business problems:

Example 1: a supply chain transformation consulting firm.

• Capability(what they do): “We help clients optimise their supply chains through advanced analytics and process redesign.”

• Business problem(what they help overcome): “Our clients come to us because their supply chain costs have spiraled out of control, and they’re struggling to meet customer demand due to stockouts and delays. They’re losing margin and customer trust.”

Example 2: a change management consulting firm.

• Capability(what they do): "We are experts in change management consulting."

• Business problem(what they help overcome): "Our clients come to us because major organizational changes are being met with resistance, leading to decreased productivity, employee frustration, and project delays. They need to ensure successful adoption of new systems or processes."

Example 3: an enterprise marketing consulting firm.

• Capability(what they do): "We offer marketing strategy development and execution."

• Business problem(what they help overcome): "Our clients are struggling with declining market share and difficulty reaching their target audience effectively. They're seeing a decrease in leads and customer engagement, impacting their revenue growth."

The difference has significant implications. The first statement describes ‘what they do’. The second one addresses thepain point. It is the pain points that prompt action.

Leading with the capability statement indirectly forces prospective clients to consider whether analytics (e.g., 1), change management (e.g., 2), or enterprise marketing (e.g., 3) is the solution to their problem. They will have to connect the dots themselves, but they often lack the expertise or time to do so effectively.

While capabilities describe a consultancy's service offering or area of expertise, business problems express the specific pain points and challenges that the consulting firm addresses. Rather than focusing solely on service descriptions, consultancies should prioritise the client’s business problems, as these serve as the primary motivators for client action.

## 4 Questions to Understand the Client’s Problem(s)

In our work with consulting firms, we always start with this advice: every consulting firm should be able to answer these four foundational questions:

• Why do clients call us?

• What goals are clients trying to achieve?

• What hurdles do clients encounter in solving the problem?

• What options do clients have to solve the problem?

### Question 1: Why do clients call us?

This question establishes the specialisation of the consulting firm. It’s not about the consultancy’s services but about the pain that triggers prospective clients to take action – get in touch with the consultancy.

The answer should be something like: “Our clients call us because they usually struggle with [insert a high-level description of the client’s business problem].”

This is the most fundamental question consulting firms should be able to answer. The answer should focus on the frustrations or risks faced by the ideal clients, convey a sense of urgency, and cut to the heart of the problem.

Once this is defined, the next step is to answer the following three critical questions to sharpen the firm’s market positioning and demonstrate a deep understanding of the client’s problem.

### Question 2: What goals are clients trying to achieve to solve the problem?

This question forces consulting firms to understand the broader goals and outcomes the client is trying to achieve, including strategic objectives, operational improvements, or long-term results that the client needs to succeed in their role.

It’s not enough to know what’s going wrong. Consulting firms should have a clear understanding of what their clients are working toward, what they want to get done, and what progress looks like in their eyes.

“People don't want a quarter-inch drill; they want a quarter-inch hole.” This quote by Theodore Levitt, a professor at Harvard Business School, serves as the foundation of the Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) concept. I recommend that consulting leaders study the JTBD concept as it forces businesses to rethink their service offering from the perspective of clients and what they are trying to achieve.

### Question 3: What hurdles do clients encounter when trying to solve this problem?

This is where consulting firms should identify the specific challenges, frustrations, and obstacles that stand in the way of their clients solving the core problem.

This question forces consultancies to dig deeper. It’s not just about the problem that the ideal clients are facing and the outcomes they try to achieve; it’s also about understanding why they haven’t solved this problem yet. What have they tried? What is the cost of inaction?

I encourage consulting firms to identify internal and external roadblocks that prevent or slow down clients’ progress. This will enable consultancies to position their expertise and services as targeted interventions designed to address clients’ specific challenges.

### Question 4: What options do clients have for solving this problem?

It is essential to recognise the alternative paths clients have at their disposal.

Consulting firms often assume that if a client has a problem and a budget, they’ll naturally reach out for help.

In reality, clients have other options. Hiring a consultancy is merely one of them. Clients can also:

• Attempt to resolve the issue internally

• Hire a freelancer

• Purchase a software tool

• Delay addressing the problem

• Do nothing

Unless consulting firms have a clear understanding of what other paths clients are considering, they can’t position themselves effectively or explain why hiring them is the best option.

## The Takeaway - Why Answering These Questions Is Essential for Consulting Firms

Too many consultancies describe what they do, rather than demonstrating their value. They offer a wide range of services, expertise areas, and frameworks during their initial interaction with prospects. They are basically answering questions that nobody cares about.

What gets clients to pay attention is the ability to answer the four questions discussed in this article.

Furthermore, answering these questions will help consulting firms:

• Sharpen (or completely rethink) their value proposition

• Strengthen their internal and external messaging

• Develop marketing and business development strategies that attract the right type of clients

• Ensure team alignment

• Create a foundation for growth by deepening the client success journey, improving processes, or focusing resources on the highest-impact problems.

# Why Consulting Value Propositions Must Include a Client Success Journey

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 13 June 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-consulting-value-propositions-must-include-a-client-success-journey

---

I always advocate for 70% of a consultancy’s revenue to come from existing clients.

Winning new clients is essential, but true financial stability is driven by efficiency and predictability – qualities that recurring revenue from existing clients provides to consulting firms.

I am astrong advocate of'programmatic client development'– a structured approach to expanding relationships with new clients and enhancinglong-term impact.

I believe that to successfully retain clients, not just occasionally but as a matter of business strategy, consulting firms should create a mechanism that enables this expansion of work. It’s about documenting processes and optimising them over time.

Designing a client success journeyis one of the best ways to achieve this.That’s the advice I give to the consultancies we work with.

Instead of delivering one-off projects, a consulting firm guides clients throughaprogressivetransformation, ensuring continuous value creation.

## A client success journey: What it is

It amazes me how many consultancies overlook the importance of proper service and client journey design. They put together a list of services they offer, determine the fees, and call it a day.

Okay, I'm exaggerating to make the point.

Then, when the going gets tough, these consulting firms expand their service range, hoping this diversification will allow them to cast a wider client and revenue net. Unfortunately, most come to the dreadful realisation that this strategy devalues the expertise and trust while adding complexity.

In my experience, profitable growth doesn’t come from piling on new services. It comes from deepening relationships with existing clients (preferably at the C-level).

When consultancies focus on strategically developing and retaining their clients, they unlock a cycle of trust, repeat business, and long-term client retention. We’ve seen this proven repeatedly across high-performing consultancies.

A client success journey is a roadmap that consulting firms can (and, in my opinion, absolutely should) develop that clearly displays what milestones the firm can help its clients achieve and what problems it can address through long-term relationships.

At the foundation of this roadmap is a clear vision of the value that will be continuously delivered to clients.

With a client success roadmap, clients are more motivated to continue the partnership, knowing a journey is designed for their success rather than just a series of ad-hoc check-ins.

Consultancies can transform one-off projects into sustained partnerships by providing tailored growth programs, setting strategic milestones, and ensuring regular high-value interventions.

*Recommended reading:The Consulting Value Proposition Quadrant*

## Implementing a client success journey: case study #1

Here’s a real-life example of how our former client, a supply chain consulting firm, designed its 4-step client success journey for a global manufacturing client.

• Challenge: A global manufacturer lacks a clear supply chain strategy, leading to inefficiencies and reactive decision-making.

• Solution: The consulting firm helps define a strategic roadmap that aligns supply chain models, risk tolerance, and cost structures with business objectives.

• Client success milestone: The company shifts from reactive problem-solving to a proactive, structured supply chain strategy that drives efficiency and resilience.

• Challenge: Volatile raw material prices and supplier dependency create instability.

• Solution: Alternative sourcing strategies, risk-sharing agreements, and predictive analytics.

• Client success milestone: Reduced exposure to supply fluctuations and more stable costs.

• Challenge: Quality inconsistencies from a key supplier pose a threat to production.

• Solution: On-site risk assessments, process improvements, and performance monitoring.

• Client success milestone: Stronger, more reliable supplier relationships, resulting in reduced defects and delays.

• Challenge: A supplier raises prices unexpectedly due to material shortages.

• Solution: Renegotiated contracts with risk-adjusted pricing, performance incentives, and penalties.

• Client success milestone: A legal framework that ensures long-term stability and supply continuity.

This example shows how consulting firms can go beyond solving isolated problems to design a structured, end-to-end client success journey. A client success journey is all about designing a path where each step builds towards lasting impact.

## Implementing a client success journey: case study #2

#### The Company and Context

This case focuses on a data and analytics consulting firm that had grown steadily but found itself stuck in a generic market position. Despite delivering technically solid projects across various industries, the firm struggled to differentiate itself and was hitting the project wall (smaller, short-term, one-off projects and a high volume of costly new client acquisition).

Working with us, they made the strategic decision to specialise in solving complex operational challenges for supermarket chains. This shift required a sharper value proposition and a redesign of their entire client engagement model, built around a clearly structured client success journey.

One of the most critical elements in making a value proposition commercially successful is translating it into a clear, actionable client success journey.

It’s not enough to define what the firm stands for; it must also demonstrate to clients how it helps them progress—step by step—toward meaningful outcomes.

I can't disclose all the details of their new value proposition (they have now shifted from selling generic data and analytics services to a specific proposition for supermarkets).

However, downstream from that new value proposition, we quickly decided together to build a typical client success journey, as they believed in showing clients how success unfolds over time. They had already achieved initial success with some of the early steps and sought a structured approach to guide clients from initial feasibility to long-term transformation.

We defined the client journey into four sequential milestones—each building logically on the previous one. This structure reflects a deliberate, progressive transformation: from foundational data work to advanced operational and customer strategy.

Specific signature methodologies enable each milestone, and each stage sets the groundwork for the next.

Goal:Ensure the client’s data landscape is fit for purpose to support advanced analytics and decision-making.

This stage establishes the feasibility of the journey ahead. It focuses on uncovering the actual condition of internal data and systems, which are often fragmented, inconsistent, or poorly integrated. Without this foundation, no transformation is possible.

Techniques and methodologies (standardised to minimise variance and complexity):

• Data audit and quality review

• Source system diagnostics

• Data cleaning, enrichment, and transformation

• Integration planning across POS, inventory, supply, and promotions data

• Readiness scoring and feasibility mapping

• Problem-to-resolution path development (serves as proposal backbone)

Goal:Convert data integrity into planning accuracy and inventory performance.

With foundational data now in place, forecasting models and inventory planning systems can be built and deployed with confidence. This stage delivers the first visible operational improvements.

How it builds on Milestone 1:Reliable forecasting and inventory insights depend entirely on structured and integrated data. Data gaps, inconsistencies, or lags—if unresolved—undermine all subsequent recommendations. Milestone 1 eliminates those barriers.

Techniques and methodologies (standardised to minimise variance and complexity):

• Baseline sales forecasting model development (statistical + ML hybrid)

• Inventory diagnostics linked to forecasted demand

• Forecast scenario planning

• Inventory optimisation modelling

• Business case development for stock reduction or reallocation

Goal:Use product movement data and forecasting outputs to inform customer-facing strategy.

Now that inventory and forecasting are stable, the focus can shift to understanding how different customer groups interact with the business. This stage delivers insight into customer behaviour and pricing opportunities.

How it builds on Milestone 2:Customer segmentation and pricing decisions rely on clean, high-quality sales and product-level data. Without accurate forecasting and inventory alignment, it’s impossible to draw trustworthy shopper insights or test pricing hypotheses.

Techniques and methodologies (standardised to minimise variance and complexity):

• Shopper segmentation model development

• Customer behaviour and loyalty analytics

• Price elasticity and sensitivity modelling

• Promotional response analysis

• Margin impact forecasting by segment and scenario

• Segmentation-based decision frameworks

Goal:Optimise physical environments and mitigate revenue leakage.

With customer-level strategies in place, the consultancy can now address in-store performance and risk mitigation. This stage connects all prior insight into tangible, operational execution.

How it builds on Milestone 3:Store layout and fraud detection analytics rely on understanding both product movement and shopper behaviour. These insights only become possible when customer and inventory systems are aligned and trustworthy.

Techniques and methodologies (standardised to minimise variance and complexity):

• Footfall pattern and dwell time analytics

• In-store conversion and layout efficiency modelling

• Fraud and shrinkage anomaly detection using sales deviation

• Store performance benchmarking

• Risk scoring frameworks tied to supplier and transaction behaviour

• Operational loss root cause analysis

This four-milestone journey is not a list of disconnected services. It’s a cumulative progression—each step unlocking new value and insight, grounded in data and reinforced by repeatable methodologies.

It allows the client to move from possibility to performance through a well-defined, structured transformation path.

Over nearly three years, the consultancy transitioned from a generic data and analytics provider to a highly specialised firm with a sharp, differentiating value proposition built around a structured client success journey. The focus on supermarkets allowed them to:

• Significantly increase their average deal size.

• Create multi-year contracts and long-term client relationships.

• Reduce client acquisition costs by focusing on upselling and deeper client relationships.

• Move from headcount-dependent growth to knowledge-based scalability.

From capability to proposition selling:

The consultancy’s journey highlights the value of intentionally designing a differentiating consulting value proposition over opportunistically growing with data and analytics services.

Narrow focus and progressive client transformation:

It demonstrated the power of deeply understanding a specific client segment (supermarkets) and building a structured client success journey, aligning services to each of the four strategic milestones, which provided a clear path for delivering measurable client value.

Tool for business development:

Crucially, the client success journey became a practical tool in business development. It is now introduced in every new client conversation—not to sell the entire journey from the outset, but to illustrate how other clients achieved success step by step.

This approach builds trust in the firm's expertise and inspires confidence by making the path tangible: "Here’s what other clients have achieved," and "Here’s how others have monetised their existing data infrastructure."

Building collective sales capability:

By designing and operationalising the entire journey, the consultancy also strengthened its collective sales capability. Explaining the offer became easier for the entire team. Outcomes became more demonstrable. And conversations shifted from selling services to guiding transformation, one milestone at a time.

From improvisation to intentional design:

It was the end of the awkward post-project call: "Is there anything else we can do for you?" Pure improvisation.

There's one more thing...

I am frequently asked whether designing a client success journey is an attempt to make the client reliant on us as a consulting firm. This is a common misconception, and the answer is a resounding no!

The ultimate goal of such a client success journey is to empower the client toachieve self-sufficiency.

It is about equipping them with the tools, knowledge, and strategies they need to thrive independently. The consulting firm's role is crucial in this process, as we focus on building and enhancing the internal expertise within the client's organisation.

This aspect of our work is often overlooked, yet it is absolutely foundational to the client's long-term success.

By fostering this internal growth, we ensure that the client is not just dependent on our services but is capable of sustaining and advancing their own operations effectively.

(Note: the supermarkets in case #2 get the choice between running the services on their own premises or on the consulting firm's systems on a subscription basis)

## Why building client success journeys delivers results

Consulting firms that focus solely on acquiring new clients and delivering one-off projects leave money on the table. Without 70% revenue from existing clients, every year starts from zero.

A client success journey creates a structured path for growth, ensuring client retention and client progress step by step towards a more resilient business.

This is the essence of programmatic client development: clients don’t just buy one service. They stay, deepen engagement, and generate the majority of the revenue.

We call it:progressive client transformation.

High-performing consulting firms excel at this. They sign up new clients by demonstrating, from the outset, specific outcomes that clients can achieve through a strategically designed client success journey and specific services linked to the success milestones in that journey.

So, start by thinking about a typical client success journey or a change adoption roadmap beyond the initial engagement, and you will quickly discover that this is an excellent starting point.

There are endless possibilities to extend high-value, long-term collaborations. Still, above all, I've learned that the best client development and relationship building occur at the senior and/or executive levels.

Poor senior/executive relationships likely mean more difficult client development, which in turn may lead to poor long-term existential health of the consulting firm.

# Why Consulting Firms Fail to Become More Strategic

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 03 June 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-consulting-firms-fail-to-become-more-strategic

---

“We want to become more strategic”.

We hear this a lot. It’s a common ambition for consulting firms.

Unfortunately, most of the consulting firms we speak with encounter difficulties on their path to providing more strategic support to their clients. They pivot, adjust, rethink, and recalibrate, yet end up with the same results:  struggling to win the kind of high-value work they set out to achieve.

Working in the trenches of the consulting industry, we noticed that when the need to be more strategic arises, it almost always stems from a structural problem in how the firm is organised. It sparks numerous discussions among the leadership team.

Most discussions concern being stuck in lower-level, lower-paid, one-off project work. What we call 'hitting the project wall'.

The consulting firm struggles to break through to longer-term, higher-value engagements where it could shape outcomes and influence strategy.

When we examine these situations, we find that the real blockers are often not related to project delivery. They’re about who delivers it, how the consulting proposition is structured, and what the firm offers.

## The Symptoms of Hitting the Project Wall

We’ve seen it multiple times: big and small consulting firms surviving at the edge of existential risk. Their revenue relies on one-time projects. Each completed project leads to another wall, another beginning, with no momentum or cumulative growth.

Understanding the symptoms of hitting the project wall is crucial for transforming a consultancy into a more strategic, stable, and growth-oriented one. Here are some of the most common and alarming symptoms:

• High Unbillable Time: A never-ending cycle of writing proposals, pitching, and onboarding new clients, resulting in significant time that can't be billed, leading to inefficiency and employee fatigue.

• Low Revenue/FTE: A lack of high-value projects, resulting in a diminished revenue generation per employee.

• Growth Ceiling: A stagnant growth pattern, unable to break through to new levels of expansion.

• High Cost of Sales (COS): The constant need to win new clients leads to significant sales costs, draining resources that could be allocated elsewhere.

• Capacity Issues: Overextension, resulting in internal capacity challenges, disrupts workflow and potentially affects delivery quality.

• Lack of Long-Term Client Relationships: Focusing on one-off projects leads to missed opportunities for deeper client engagement and recurring revenue.

• Reactive Instead of Proactive Approach: The continuous scramble for new projects fosters a reactive culture, missing the opportunity to strategically position the consultancy for future success.

Capacity Issues: Overextension, resulting in internal capacity challenges, disrupts workflow and potentially affects delivery quality.

These symptoms point to the hard truth: the firm isn’t built to offer more strategy-focused solutions.

## Why the Ambition to “Become More Strategic” Often Fails

Superficial changes are simply not enough. To successfully break through the project wall, consulting firms must fundamentally rethink their business setup.

And that’s why so many consulting firms fail.

### 1. Capability Selling

If the firm continues to sell its capabilities (“We do X”) instead of a problem-solving business case that resonates at the top (“We solve X”), it remains tactical by design. Strategy demands a C-level-proof value proposition, issue-based & outcome-led. Not a ‘here’s-what-we-do’ service menu.

We’ve seen many consulting firms fall into this trap. They rely on long lists of services and technical competencies, hoping clients will connect the dots. They won't.

### 2. Experienced ‘Strategy People’

C-level executives address macro-level business problems. So if a firm lacks senior consultants with the depth and experience to challenge clients at an executive level, it will struggle to attract strategic work, regardless of ambition.

And it’s not just about years of experience. Senior consultants should not hesitate to ask difficult questions. They should be able to offer perspectives that show their superior understanding of how micro issues impact the larger picture. That’s how they build trust.Without this depth of expertise, consulting firms win only low-risk, execution-focused work.

### 3. Workload

If the team is overloaded with operational project delivery, there’s no capacity to invest in strategic client development. Intent is irrelevant without time.

When a firm is stretched thin, even the most capable and experienced consultants lack the will, inspiration, or resources to develop deeper relationships with clients, evaluate and reorganise processes, or create more strategy-based offerings that lead to long-term partnerships.

### 4. C-level Access

Strategy work will remain out of reach if the team can’t build relationships and relevance at the executive level. Decision-makers, not lower-level management, award strategic work. Moving upstream with downstream work rarely works.

While many hope that they can “build their way up”, this rarely happens. Why? Because access to C-level decision-makers requires a different service offering, problem-resolution approach, and value proposition.

## Getting Over the Project Wall Is a Design Choice

Rethinking the fundamentals is not easy. And then actually going through with the new design requires grit and determination.

Back in the days, when I, Luk, ran my iNostix consultancy, I grew tired of feeling the pressure of constantly chasing prospects and having to figure out how to deliver a project because my ego-driven self said yes to every opportunity.

So here’s what I did to break through the wall:

• Sharpen the value proposition: I made sure that our clients understood what we stood for. A specific proposition was the basis for trust and repeat business.

• Design strategic service offerings: We always built in service continuity beyond the first project, shaping long-term client success journeys.

• Build executive relationships: Long-term alliances are only possible by earning the trust of C-level executives. It was central to our growth.

• Connect to executive agendas: Even when projects started with lower priorities, I linked our work to what mattered at the top: growth, risk, speed, or cost, to name a few.

• Align with goals and budgets: I helped clients define OKRs and support their budgeting (short-term, mid-term, and long-term).

• Support internal capability building: By advising on team design and regularly sharing content to build client expertise and confidence.

## How to Start Moving in the Right Direction

Many firms looking to “go proposition-led” and do more strategy work think this means adding a strategy "layer" to their business: A few slides. A new workshop. Maybe a thought leadership campaign.

But that’s not the shift.

To become a proposition-led firm, consulting firms can’t just offer strategy. They need to build the business around a single, defined client success journey from an issue to an outcome.

• Strategy work and execution work must serve the same proposition

• IP, sales process, and delivery must reflect one coherent point of view

• Stopping “doing everything for everyone”

Here’s the starting point we recommend:

### 1. Re-architect Strategy and Execution Around a Shared Proposition

No more treating “strategy” as an optional top layer. No more delivering execution without precise framing.

• Use strategy to define the right problem to solve

• Use execution to deliver the solution, with purpose and control

• Make sure both are inseparable parts of the same client journey

When that happens, clients don’t just buy deliverables. They buy clarity. Ownership. Outcomes.

### 2. Require Prospects to Start With Strategy

If you want to shift your model, you’ll have to shift your entry points. And yes, this means saying:

“We never jump straight into delivery. First, we help you frame the problem. That’s how we set every engagement up for success.”

David C. Baker, in his book 'The Business of Expertise', illustrates this concept with a metaphor: imagine a house with a front room and a back room. Visitors must pass through the front room, representing a firm’s discovery or strategy offerings, before reaching the back room, which represents the firm’s execution capabilities.

Build your consulting firm like this!

No new client gains access to the backroom (there is no backroom door), even if the initial request is more downstream or executional.

Our TVA recommendation closely mirrors this idea: we advise clients to treat strategic review or discovery work as the minimum threshold for engaging with new clients. Yes, even if your firm is primarily known for execution. And yes, even if it feels like it might cost you a deal or two (which it usually won’t).

It’s the only way to be seen as a serious professional advisor—and to avoid being commoditised.

### 3. Design the Full Client Journey Around This Shift

Once you’ve rebuilt the front-end and reset your client entry points, ensure that your entire go-to-market strategy, delivery rhythm, and team structures evolve to support the proposition.

## How This Employee Engagement Consultancy Transformed From a Survey Vendor to a Strategic Advisor.

This consulting firm told us, “We want to add a strategic service”.

Our answer: Don’t add a strategic layer on top of an existing downstream proposition, it doesn’t work. You will still be perceived as the downstream survey firm. Instead, redefine the ENTIRE PROPOSITION and become a strategic advisory firm (and yes, you can still do the survey work).

It’s NOT about ‘ADDING A STRATEGIC LAYER’.

Here’s what happened with this HR consulting firm and their long-standing survey-first proposition.

They were known for: strong methodology, academic background, and loyal clients.

Post-COVID, the market changed. Cheaper survey tools flooded in. Apps and startups everywhere. They became vendor instead of advisors.

They came to us with a clear goal: “We want to move upstream. We want to be seen as strategic advisors, not survey vendors.”

Here’s what we helped them do: Lead with a business-critical problem, and redesign the proposition around it.

We helped them reframe their engagement survey work around a few sharp, high-stakes issues. One of them: 'Reducing regretted attrition in critical teams'.

That shift changed everything:

• The conversation no longer started with a survey discussion. It started with the business risk(s).

• The survey became a means to an end, rather than the main service itself.

• The new proposition was designed by clarifying the problem in business terms, linking it to what was at stake (growth, margin, etc.), defining the transformation clients could expect, and demonstrating a structured path to achieve that.

The outcome: a redesign of the consulting proposition as ‘one house, one front door, no backdoor, one journey’.

They didn’t add a strategic layer to their survey work. They rebuilt the entire proposition with the help of the ‘one-house metaphor’*. All NEW CLIENTS now enter through the strategy room by engaging with the business problem first.

There’s no separate entry for doing surveys only. Their clients used to come for ‘the doing’. That door doesn’t exist anymore. Execution still happens, but only as part of the entire transformation journey, as a means to an end.

NEW clients want to do a quick survey? Go download an app!

One house. Two rooms. One entry. No backdoor. One journey.

If the entry point for a new client isn’t strategic, the consulting firm will never ‘become more strategic’. Strategy will always remain optional!

In the case of the HR consultancy, they are either a survey vendor at the brink of being disrupted or an HR consulting firm helping to solve high-stakes business challenges.

## The Takeaway: Gradually Shifting Towards Proposition-Led Work, The Route to Becoming More Strategic

In moving to ‘becoming more strategic,’ consulting firms might worry about disrupting what is currently working. But the shift doesn’t have to happen all at once.

Consulting firms can start by piloting their proposition-led approach in a focused area, such as a single issue, vertical, or buyer group, while the rest of the firm continues to deliver.

This doesn't have to be a ‘flip of the switch’, changing the entire identity of the consulting firm.

However, in the end, it must happen over time if consulting firms want to stop being defined by prospect-chasing, RFPs, and constantly reinventing the wheel.

Shifting to "proposition-led" doesn’t mean stacking strategy on top of execution. It means making every part of the firm serve the same issue-resolution, point of view, and client success journey.

That’s when consultancies overcome being seen as just a vendor and become a partner clients choose to lead with.

# There Are Two Ways to Run a Consulting Firm. One Drains Profitability.

This article was last updated on 30 May 2025.

Most consulting firms don’t fail because of market conditions. They fail because they create their underperformance, one step at a time.

Over the past years, we have worked with a few dozen such consulting firms. This self-sabotage comes in different forms:

• Consultancy owners and leaders are not aligned around the same vision for business growth, so everyone is doing what they think is best.

• A consultancy is in constant 'pivot' mode, launching new services without the patience or resources to mature a single one (an exercise that takes, on average, around two years).

• Project execution does not have defined methodologies, which means a consultancy’s deliverables and processes vary widely depending on who leads the engagement.

• Ad-hoc marketing and business development efforts typically result in campaigns launched sporadically without a long-term plan and inconsistent returns.

And at the foundation of all these problems is their approach to selling their consulting services.

They sell 'what they do': "We do strategy, research, org design, digital roadmaps, workshops, process redesign" (to name a few). In short,they are selling capabilities: "We do X".

At some point, the firm becomes a machine that sells more and more of that capability, regardless of whether clients need it.

The result? Broad targeting. Bloated proposals. Custom everything. An operations nightmare. Profit erodes while headcount balloons.

This is thecapabilities-sellingmodeof running a consulting firm, and it almost always guarantees underperformance – at least, that's what we have experienced.

## Capability Selling vs. Proposition Selling

The real difference is this:

• Capabilities-sellingconsulting firmsemphasise "We do" and "We offer," presenting proposals like menus. Their profitability relies on selling more hours and selling one-off projects, leaving clients to discern the usefulness of those capabilities.

• Proposition selling consulting firmsfocus on selling solutions to clearly defined problems: "We solve for X". They offer transformative results. They clearly identify the problem and outline the potential outcomes of a successful transformation. They develop a structured approach to achieve these outcomes and inspire potential clients by educating them on the value and impact of these transformations.

Proposition selling consulting firmsfocus on selling solutions to clearly defined problems: "We solve for X". They offer transformative results. They clearly identify the problem and outline the potential outcomes of a successful transformation. They develop a structured approach to achieve these outcomes and inspire potential clients by educating them on the value and impact of these transformations.

And that changes everything, from how you price to scale to how clients perceive your transformative value.

## Why Capabilities Selling Is a Silent Profit Killer for Consulting Firms

Sure, positioning a consultancy as 'experts in [something]' seems logical, but without being specific and offering a laser-sharp value proposition (issue-led and outcome-focused), a consulting firm is forced to chase revenue in a broad target market, often attracts misaligned clients, and accepts a variety of projects.

This expands complexity, not profitability.

The more a consultancy grows this way, the more complex scaling becomes. Headcount increases, operational strain rises, and margins shrink. The firm is constantly running but never truly progressing.

This opportunism-driven strategy is a profit-eater in consulting firms:

• Broad targeting → chasing revenue: Without a clear value proposition, consulting firms accept whatever comes their way. Marketing is scattered, client fit is poor, and price competition erodes margins.

• Constant variance → increasing complexity: Projects differ wildly, making it hard to develop repeatable methods. The result? Higher delivery costs, heavy reliance on individuals, and low scalability.

• Growth tied to headcount → no scalability: More projects means more hires but not more profit. Consulting firms end up growing headcount and overhead faster than margins.

• Operational strain → lower margins: Inefficiencies pile up. Every custom engagement adds friction, hurting client attraction, delivery, and profitability.

Selling capabilities is challenging for a consulting firm and creates a self-imposed ceiling on growth and profitability.

### Selling Capabilities Is the Shortest Path to Commoditisation in Consulting

In our experience, selling capabilities almost inevitably leads to commoditisation.

Think of how most firms introduce themselves:

• “We do digital transformation.”

• “We are experts in change management.”

• “We help with strategy and execution.”

These are not propositions. They are not. They don’t answer the essential question: “To what end and for whom?”

And when buyers can’t tell the difference, they default to price. This is how even highly skilled consulting firms find themselves caught in what we call thecapability-commoditisation trap:

• Clients pick on price, because they have endless alternatives that sound identical: other firms, contractors, freelancers, even AI.

• Projects vary wildly and start from scratch, since there’s no repeatable, structured journey from problem to outcome.

• Delivery becomes people-dependent and hard to scale.

• Growth becomes synonymous with hiring, not with increased profitability.

## Consulting Growth Based on Proposition Selling

Here are just a few examples of the types of considerations that high-performing firms make in their strategy development:

• They define a differentiated, outcome-specific value proposition.They solve a well-defined business issue with precision. They don’t sell capabilities; they sell value, outcomes, and transformational results. This approach attracts the right clients, allows them to command premium pricing, and builds a reputation as the go-to consulting firm in their expertise domain.

• They narrow their targeting: They don't care about reaching as many prospects as possible. They only care about reaching the right ones. High-performing consultancies focus on attracting their ideal clients, allowing them to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

• They standardise and refine processes: Developing proprietary methodologies and frameworks means setting up clearly defined processes, tech, and other resources. This increases efficiency, reduces delivery variability, and keeps clients happy, resulting in repeat business. Their repeatable processes allow them to lower costs and improve quality.

• They scale strategically: Growth in high-performing consulting firms is repeatable and efficient, and it’s not tied to headcount growth. New services are not launched out of desperation. Instead, they are launched to deepen the value offered to existing clients.

## An Example of a Change From "We Do X" to "We Solve for X"

I always get questions when talking or writing about capability selling: "What does it mean?" Here's a real-life example of a consulting firm we worked with.

• The old capability-selling approach was: “We are experts in change management.” (Shouting into the void: “Who needs change management?”)

• The new, proposition-led approach is:“We help large enterprise companies (>500M) in [country name] reduce post-merger integration time by 40-50% while aligning leadership and culture.”

Change management ('the capability') is no longer mentioned. Instead, the business impact they can achieve for a specific audience in a well-defined context (post-merger challenges) is clearly defined.

This example is just a glimpse into an extensive refinement process we've undertaken. Beyond redefining the overarching value proposition, we also redesigned the underlying service offering architecture, the client success journey, the signature methodology, the thought leadership pillars, and the new business development approach (to name the principal components of their transformation).

Each change is a step towards transforming into a high-performing consulting firm.

## The Ultimate Comparison: Capability vs Proposition Selling

This table provides a comprehensive overview of the key dimensions that differentiate these two approaches.

By examining these characteristics, we can better understand how proposition selling leads to superior performance and sustainable growth, while capabilities selling often results in inefficiencies, underperformance, and, ultimately, commoditisation.

## Final thoughts: Underperformance Is a Choice!

In our experience, consulting firms often attribute their struggles to external pressures: market conditions, competition, changing client expectations, and so on. But the reality is different. More often than not, their biggest obstacle is internal.

There are two ways to run a consulting firm. Which path are you setting your consultancy on?

If your consulting firm still leads with “We do X,” it’s time to pause and ask: To what end? And for whom?

Without a crystal-clear, specific, outcome-led answer, you may already be caught in the capability trap. This approach is quietly eroding your margins, weakening your positioning, and making growth unsustainable.

The only way out is to reframe your proposition around the business issue you solve, who you solve it for, and how your firm is uniquely equipped to deliver that high-impact transformation.

# The Old Consulting Model Is Out. Welcome to the Outcome Economy.

**Autor:** Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 20 May 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/old-consulting-model-is-out-welcome-to-outcome-economy

---

We work with consultancies every day, examining their business models, business development approaches, sales cycles, external messaging, marketing strategies, and financials.

As we compare what high-performing consultancies do differently from run-of-the-mill firms, we observe a widening gap in performance and profitability. This gap is driven by drastically different approaches to how these consulting firms perceive and communicate their value.

We refer to these approaches as theoldandnewconsulting models.

In this article, I’ll explain the difference between the two models and why one challenges consulting firms while the other fuels strategic growth.

## Oldvs.NewConsulting Model

The old model is essentially built around going to market by selling a capability: "We are experts in X. Who here needs X?"

These firms are selling their capacity: “Oh, you need X? Great, we’ve got 10 people who are excellent in X available.”

Capability and capacity selling.

As a result, most of these consulting firms usually do project-based work and grow rather opportunistically. Since they haven’t clearly defined how clients should best apply their expertise, they end up taking on almost any project that seems like a fit.

That’s how most consulting firms get started, and it’s a valid model. However, it is not fit for long-term growth and scaling.

This old model is under increasing pressure today. With the rise of freelance/contractor platforms, software solutions, and AI, clients have many other ways of accessing expertise and capacity, and many of them come with a much more straightforward proposition.

There's also more competition than ever. With large firms downsizing and tech companies shedding staff, many more experts are launching their own consultancies.

Consulting firms that operate under the new model don’t promote raw capabilities. Instead, they sell outcomes, specifically what clients want to achieve: “We will help you achieve X.”

Instead of showcasing their capabilities, they define the typical business problem they can solve, paint a clear picture of the transformation that can be achieved, and lay out a structured path to success.

By educating potential clients on the impact of the transformation, they position themselves as partners in solving real client challenges, not just providers of expertise.

The two approaches dramatically shift how a consulting firm positions itself in the market. This shift is often a significant leap for both boutique and larger firms.

### A - fictional - example: from “we help with digital transformation” to a much more specific proposition

So, how can a firm begin to design its refined proposition intentionally

Let’s start with a vague, capability-led statement like “We help with digital transformation.” A more outcome-oriented approach would involve asking sharper questions:

• What’s broken with most transformation initiatives?

• What are clients actually trying to fix or achieve?

• How does our consulting firm uniquely help?

By reframing and reorienting the firm’s capabilities and services around these questions (an exercise we like to ground in a consultancy’s recent successes, utilising a framework what we call the ‘best engagements review’), the proposition may then evolve into a clearer expression of the firm’s focus, expertise, and transformational value.

• “Moving to the cloud, without the spend creep”

• “Protect your IT investments, get more from your legacy systems”

• “You’ve bought analytics. Now, get better cost control.”

• “Stop overpaying for cybersecurity already.”

• “Get the user adoption rates you expected.”

These aren’t final taglines—they're directional examples. However, they highlight a key principle:lead with the pain point or desired outcome. Once you’ve opened the door with a relevant proposition, you earn the right to explain how your firm delivers it.

Remember, though, that value proposition design is not about finding a clever new slogan for your services. It’s about anchoring your proposition in the specific business issues your target clients face and articulating the concrete transformation and outcomes you help them achieve.

*Recommended reading:There Are Two Ways to Run a Consulting Firm. One Drains Profitability.*

## How the Old Consulting Model Undermines Growth

The two core problems with capability-selling consulting firms:

a)Buyer behaviour:they aren’t aligned with how buyers search and buy professional services. Potential clients do their homework; they seek problem-resolution expertise/experience, not mere capabilities.

b)Commoditisation:they often end up in a “commodity position” as they sell vaguely explained (laundry lists of) services to an unspecified target market (not explaining the ideal client profile) and are not particularly differentiated.

When consulting firms focus on promoting their capabilities, this may occur:

• Confusion:They force prospects to determine how these capabilities might benefit them in their specific (problem) context. Clients must connect the dots and figure out how the consulting firm's service offerings align with their needs, which can lead to confusion and hesitation in making decisions.

• Marketing inefficiency:This confusion, in turn, impacts the ability of marketing and business development campaigns to attract the right people and convert leads.

• Service provider profile:When old-model firms are hired, they often find themselves in the role of mere service providers, facing relentless pricing pressure and scrutiny from procurement. They are frequently subjected to intense negotiations and have minimal control over the engagement and scope management.

• Growth blocker:Ultimately, in the long run, it impacts growth. Client acquisition costs are higher. Due to the high variance in projects, creating consistent success stories or retaining clients effectively is challenging. Moreover, even when consultancies detain clients, it is often by saying “yes” to almost everything, which adds complexity to the consulting firm's management.

The result? Even when it appears on the surface that a consultancy is growing, its margins erode over time, creating financial instability.

## The Barriers to Transitioning to the New Consulting Model

Proposition-led selling in consulting helps clients understand how to use a consultancy's expertise. In other words, it specifies the target audience, which problem(s) are solved, and clarifies the benefits and outcomes clients can expect, reducing confusion and helping them make informed decisions.

Now, shifting from the old to the new model isn't as easy as hammering out new messaging or updating your website. It requires a foundational shift in how the consulting firm thinks about itself and how it goes to market.

There are a lot of barriers to making that change. Here are some common ones that we’ve come across in our work with consulting firms:

• Opportunism (or "flexibility"): Saying “yes” to everything in hopes of new work, diluting the firm’s expertise. It is often a coping mechanism for not having a refined proposition. It’s baked into the core of many consultancies.

• FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): Refusing to specialise because “we might miss out on some opportunity!” Many leaders fear that by narrowing their focus, they will miss out on revenue streams.

• Entrepreneurial curiosity: Burning out the team because “exploring the unknown is such a thrill!” Many founders relish new challenges and flourish in ambiguity. Unfortunately, reinventing the wheel every week introduces complexity and results in team frustration and long-term inefficiencies.

• Ego, pride, and “me-me-me”: Focusing on the firm and its greatness instead of a client’s pains and needs. Whether it’s ego or legacy thinking, many consulting leaders talk about how great the consultancy is, how exceptional the people are and how strong their culture is. Prospects’ pain points, priorities, needs, and opportunities become an afterthought.

• Misaligned incentives: Rewarding revenue generation, no matter what sort of project, reinforces a culture of opportunism. If a compensation structure rewards behaviours aligned with capability selling, consulting firms reinforce the very habits they are trying to change, rather than embracing proposition-selling that focuses on solving specific client problems.

• “Rescue-us” senior hires: Appointing senior staff from large consulting firms can lead to challenges, as they are used to capability-selling and taking on nearly any project. This method can be problematic when a new consulting firm transitions to a proposition-led model, as these seniors may find it difficult to adapt and continue selling broadly, which is characteristic of larger firms.

## Moving Forward: From Capability Selling to Selling Clarity and Impact

The era of winning work by listing capabilities and services is over. Today’s clients are no longer buying breadth. They’re buying clarity. Confidence. Outcomes.

Shifting from the old to the new model, from capability selling to proposition selling, demands more than a new pitch deck. It requires a redefinition of how the consulting firm positions, sells, and delivers, starting with how it defines its own identity.

It’s not an easy leap. But it’s the only path to:

• Pricing power based on perceived value.

• Longer, deeper client relationships.

• More predictable, sustainable growth.

Pricing power based on perceived value.

Longer, deeper client relationships.

More predictable, sustainable growth.

In our experience, the consulting firms that break away from the default old model and commit to a sharp, issue-led, and outcome-based proposition outperform, not occasionally, but consistently.

The future belongs to the new model.

# How Thought Leadership Has Been Driving My Business Development for 15+ Years

There is much research on the value of thought leadership to business growth. In this article, I’ll share some of the most relevant findings from such research.However, when I started my thought leadership journey, it wasn’t because of any such findings. I wasn’t even aware of the existence of those studies.I did it because, in my daily work as a consultancy owner and senior expert, I gained a vast amount of 'experiences from the consulting trenches' that could benefit my extensive network.My simple goal was to provide value to my immediate network – people I manually added to my Outlook mailing list (mailing applications weren’t on my radar screen).I didn’t realise then that this urge to share case studies, learnings, advice, and observations would become the most impactful business development strategy I could ever have hoped for.In this article, I’d like to explain why sharing expertise is a wise business development investment and how consulting firms can make it a win-win for clients and prospects and their business growth.

## Growing two consulting businesses on the back of expertise-sharing

### Consultancy #1: iNostix – Stumbling into the thought leadership-powered business development model

In 2008, I founded iNostix, a boutique consultancy that offered people analytics advisory services to large enterprises. As with any new business, we were eager to hit the ground running, which meant acquiring clients at all costs.I have to admit. At first, I let my ego get the best of me. I would say yes to almost any project that came our way. I loved bringing in big clients. I used to call the office with the message: you won’t believe what I just sold. The answer of the team: “damn, did you do that again?”I was proud to sell projects we had never done before. My ego wanted to crush every new opportunity that came my/our way.Recommended reading:Why you should share expertise to grow a consulting business.While the business was growing nicely, I was finding myself increasingly overwhelmed. Unsurprisingly, I reached the inevitable burnout.At that point, I decided to step back and reevaluate my business priorities. I realised that what I was doing daily – endless follow-ups, micromanaging my teams because I was constantly throwing them into the unknown with the new projects, spending hours looking at the financials, overseeing marketing, etc. – was not satisfying me or the entire team.That’s when I started my thought leadership journey. For me, it was a reflective exercise.I looked back at the projects our consultancy had completed and started documenting our experiences and learnings: what problems we solved, who we did this for, what triggered them to call us for help, what questions and objections they had, what we were able to achieve, what we had learned, and how that fitted into the larger picture of where those enterprises were headed.In no time, I had a library of content, and I started sharing my ‘wisdom from the consulting trenches’, insights I believed my network could benefit from.So, I compiled a mailing list with my (extensive) Outlook contact list and started sending my content without a particular schedule. I tried doing it regularly, but there was no specific format or design I adhered to and no testing of which day of the week and what time delivered the best response rates.After a few months, I noticed a change: I started receiving emails and calls from people outside my network. “Hi, Luk, my former colleague Ben sent me an article you shared with him and the issue you helped Company X with is similar to what we’re struggling with. Do you think iNostix can assist?”Due to the value of the content I was sharing, I didn’t realise it was being re-shared by my network. Prospects started seeking us out more and more.It seemed like the ultimate dream: large companies were reaching out to us to complete projects that big, international consulting firms were desperately trying to win. We won proposal after proposal against the Big 4, who didn’t share similar ‘experiences from the trenches’ and never got to the visibility and reputation level we had (which ultimately resulted in the acquisition by Deloitte in 2016).We found ourselves in the position that most consulting firms strive to be in: prospects came to us, and we had to make tough decisions about which projects to accept and which to decline politely.In 2016, Deloitte acquired iNostix. Our impressive client list, which we had built up by that point, was an essential factor, but it was not the only one.Here’s what Deloitte communicated to the press in 2016: “One of the main drivers behind the acquisition was Luk’s status as a well-known global thought leader in the people analytics consulting space. Luk has proven that amplifying visibility as a consultant is more than a feel-good marketing technique.”

### Consultancy #2: TheVisibleAuthority.com – Developing a deliberate thought leadership-powered business development model

When I founded TheVisibleAuthority.com in 2019, I sincerely believed in thought leadership. I had witnessed firsthand the incredible power of being generous with my knowledge and experiences.By now, I have developed a set of best practices that I could use as a foundation for starting a consulting business from scratch.

• I started building up a catalogue of thought leadership pieces ahead of time;

• I actively researched my target audience and conducted 15 in-depth interviews to help me understand what business issues they were dealing with, what they were looking to achieve, how they go about their decision-making process, etc.

• I developed a preliminary editorial calendar that incorporated all the main themes I wanted to address,

• I purchased a subscription to Hubspot that would allow me to publish my pieces, distribute them, and track analytics in a single platform.

I started TheVisibleAuthority.com right before the global pandemic paralyzed the world. “How unfortunate!” – many people told me. Their sentiment made sense. Established businesses were struggling to stay afloat, and I was closing the first year of my brand-new business.Thought leadership carried my business through the massive uncertainty we all – people and businesses – faced.My new consulting business flourished despite the pandemic. While face-to-face business development in consulting became impossible, my approach to business development and business growth through expertise sharing became increasingly in demand.The pandemic accelerated my visibility and reputation, and I currently have more requests than I can handle. This means I am once again able to hand-pick my ideal clients.More client education means more revenue.I’ve spent 20-30% of my time writing to educate my target audience over the past 5 years. And when I write, I never think of generating revenue. Never.But the more I educate (and write), the more revenue it generates. 90% of new clients find me through the experiences I share. It’s like real estate: the more assets you buy, the more value you create.Business development in consulting is rooted in educating the target audience. Building trust at scale.

## Expertise-sharing: A data-backed business development strategy

As mentioned at the beginning of my article, when I started my thought leadership journey, I was unaware of the studies on its impact on business development. I am acutely aware of them now, however.So, for those consulting partners, owners or leaders who need further proof of the transformational business power of putting time and effort into consistently sharing knowledge, I’d like to share some of the most relevant findings of various studies conducted on the subject.✔️ Edelman:According to theEdelman-LinkedIn 2024 study:

• Thought leadership helps build trust with the target audience: 73% of decision-makers say that an organisation’s thought leadership content is a more trustworthy basis for assessing its capabilities and competencies than its marketing materials and product sheets.Furthermore, 54% say that an organisation consistently producing high-quality thought leadership content has prompted them to research its offerings or capabilities.

• Thought leadership directly impacts business development: 9 in 10 executives say they are moderately or very likely to be more receptive to sales or marketing outreach from a company that consistently produces high-quality thought leadership.86% of decision-makers say they are moderately or very likely to invite organisations that consistently produce high-quality thought leadership to participate in the RFP process.Yet, only 38% of TL producers expect their organisation’s thought leadership content to invite them to participate in an RFP process.

✔️ Dentsu:Clients are less loyal than ever to their existing partners.According to Dentsu, the incumbent loss rate increased from 29% to 34% in the past two years.

And what makes clients switch to other consultancies? Among other things, it’s the lack of thought leadership. Edelman-LinkedIn’s study discovered that 54% of decision-makers say the piece of thought leadership got them to realise there were other suppliers they could work with that better understood the challenges their organisation was facing.✔️ Content Marketing Institute:What makes a thought leadership strategy successful? According to astudy by the famous Content Marketing Institute:

• The top performers attribute their success primarily to understanding their audience – 82%.

• Other factors include:Producing high-quality content – 77%Possessing industry expertise – 70%

• Producing high-quality content – 77%

• Possessing industry expertise – 70%

✔️ Momentum/ITSMA:Finally, astudy by Momentum ITSMAshows that those who derive high ROIs from their thought leadership can do so because they are proactive in their strategy:

• Leaders are more likely than laggards to monitor feedback from clients/readers (62% vs 43%), brand value (52% vs 34%), sign-ups/subscribers (38% vs 16%), and brand trust (38% vs 13%).

Given such overwhelming evidence, I am amazed how many boutique consultancy owners stubbornly refuse to allocate sufficient time regularly to share their expertise!

## If consulting leaders are invisible in the market, their business runs on borrowed time

Too many consulting firm leaders, owners and partners are quiet when they should be educating and inspiring. Silence is a liability in a consulting market that thrives on trust and credibility.I’ve seen this pattern far too often: consulting firms rely on their immediate networks, word-of-mouth referrals, or the occasional marketing push, which they don’t believe in.Here’s the problem!Networks shrink, referrals dry up, and the consulting firm fades into the background without consistent visibility.Some consulting leaders tell me they don’t know what to write about (I really don't get that). Others think it's a task for someone else. Worse, some assume that delivering excellent client work alone will keep the pipeline full.It won’t.Consulting is a trust business, and trust is built through the visibility of expertise. Leaders must educate their market, share insights from the trenches, and inspire their audience long before a prospect becomes a client.This doesn’t mean posting a few bot-generated, boring blog posts (which is the case in too many consultancies) or resharing generic industry updates. It means bringing their unique voice, perspective, and expertise to the table. It means becoming a leading voice. The go-to specialist prospects think of when they face a challenge.Let’s not forget that 90% of consulting buyers do their research before reaching out. If you’re not visible in that process, you’re not even in the running.

#### Here's my advice

• Lead by sharing experiences. Share real insights, client challenges, and lessons learned from the trenches. Educate and inspire, not just promote.

• Focus on building trust at scale. Credibility can be built through consistent, valuable content, such as case studies, practical advice, and unique perspectives. Trust scales when your expertise becomes discoverable. Let marketing focus on the scaling effort, but you are leading.

• Stop waiting for the perfect topic. Your experiences and problem-solving approaches are goldmines. Start with what you know best and how it helps clients.

• Ensure that leadership visibility is balanced with a collective approach to avoid over-reliance on a single individual. While visible leaders are crucial for building trust at scale, they can inadvertently cause a critical commercial risk if they exit or resign. Cultivate a team-based strategy to maintain continuity and resilience.

## LinkedIn, my 'virtual conference room'

Most consultancy owners/partners totally misunderstand LinkedIn.They are stuck in archaic thinking about LinkedIn, treating it as a bulletin board for self-promotion or as a picture diary of all sorts of events.You know what? You are missing the point of social engagement for business growth.While you muse over the pictures of your fabulous keynote presentation from last week (that doesn’t drive real engagement), your LinkedIn-savvy competitors are engaging in real-time with clients and prospects, learning directly from the market through immediate feedback on their shared viewpoints, on-the-spot sharpening their thinking with each interaction.They understand the power of instant feedback loops — how a single post can trigger insightful discussions, and become a two-way street of insights, where the feedback they receive is as valuable as the expertise they share.That is the currency of influence on LinkedIn, and you're letting it slip through your fingers.Bypass LinkedIn, and you bypass deep client understanding.

#### Here's my advice

I always think of LinkedIn as a 'virtual conference room'.Content on my website may gather digital dust and may remain unchallenged, whereas LinkedIn breathes split-second life into my words, my thinking, and my expertise.It’s a dynamic space where immediate reactions from a global audience can enrich our perspective as consultancy leaders.Each comment, each share, and each piece of feedback is a free lesson in market demands, client pain points, and industry understanding.Saying you don't have time for LinkedIn (what too many consultancy owners/partners say) is like saying you don't have time to understand the market.Here’s my harsh point of view: your LinkedIn reluctance as a consultancy owner or partner is a strategic blunder that constrains your firm's growth and silences your expertise in a world that never stops talking.In the meantime, your biggest competitor gets awesome market intelligence from LinkedIn - insights you will never get.And that competitor is only one easy click away from your clients and prospects.

## There's one more thing: AI

While AI is a powerful tool, it should not be used to write your thought leadership from A to Z.

Thought leadership requires a personal voice, unique insights from the trenches of your work, and a deep understanding of your field that AI cannot replicate.

#### Here's how we use AI

• We utilise AI to proofread and enhance our text, ensuring clarity and precision, especially since English is not my native language.

• AI helps us summarise content and suggest concluding paragraphs based on our existing writing.

• It assists in analysing our content catalogue to suggest improvements, identify additional subjects for deeper exploration, brainstorm underrepresented topics, and propose new topics based on our recorded project work.

AI is a valuable assistant in refining and expanding our content, but the essence of thought leadership must come from genuine human experiences from the trenches and not 'invented stuff' from ChatGPT (which I am seeing way too much).

## In conclusion

I built trust and credibility by delivering meaningful insights and engaging authentically with my audience, ultimately leading to two thriving consultancy businesses.

The success of iNostix and TheVisibleAuthority.com—not to mention the dozens of examples I have encountered working with high-performing boutique consultancies—proves how thought leadership can organically drive growth and set a consultancy apart from its competitors.

Today, research provides compelling evidence supporting the impact of thought leadership on business development. Decision-makers favour companies that consistently share high-quality insights.

My experience aligns with this data, proving that being proactive and strategic about sharing expertise attracts prospects and positions consultancies as leaders in their field.

Incorporating platforms like LinkedIn as a 'virtual conference room' amplifies this strategy, offering real-time engagement and invaluable market insights. It’s a dynamic space where immediate feedback can refine our perspectives and enhance our understanding of client needs.

Meanwhile, AI functions as a powerful tool to enhance and broaden our content, ensuring clarity and precision. The essence of thought leadership must remain grounded in authentic human experiences, which is at the core of consulting work.

Committing to a thought leadership strategy, leveraging LinkedIn for engagement, and utilising AI for content enhancement are no longer optional for boutique consultancy owners. They are essential for long-term success.

If you’re not building trust at scale, you’re building irrelevance.

# How to Structure Multiple Value Propositions Without Losing Your Firm’s Identity

**Autor:** Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 05 May 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-to-structure-multiple-value-propositions-without-losing-your-firms-identity

---

For leaders of multi-service consultancies, one challenge crops up time and again: how do you position your firm with clarity when you're serving a wide range of clients, contexts, and challenges?

Too often, the default is to try to cover everything under one umbrella proposition. But that “one-size-fits-all” approach is rarely fit for purpose. It’s either too generic to be useful (“We help clients solve complex problems”) or so watered down it fails to guide any real decisions about marketing, sales, offers, or even hiring.

The answer isn’t to simplify your firm’s positioning down to one tidy tagline. It’s to embrace the complexity, but structure it with intention.

## Why a Single Proposition Falls Short

At some point in a consulting firm’s growth, the leadership team realizes that their original value proposition - crafted when they were a single-practice or founder-led team - no longer reflects the business they’re running. It doesn’t speak to their strategy, their breadth of capabilities, or the evolving sophistication of their clients.

A single firm-wide proposition becomes a bottleneck. It’s too vague to support specific sales motions. It can’t flex to the real differences between a digital transformation buyer in a global enterprise and a cost-reduction buyer in a mid-market business.

But the solution isn’t to let a thousand propositions bloom. That’s a fast track to brand confusion, internal misalignment, and messaging chaos.

Instead, smart firms adopt atiered value proposition model- one that aligns every layer of positioning without losing strategic coherence.

*Recommended reading:Want More Clients? Stop Talking About Your Expertise!*

## The Three-Layer Proposition Model

### Layer One: The Firm-Wide Umbrella Proposition

Every consultancy needs a clear, cohesive statement of what it exists to solve - regardless of service line. This is your umbrella. It’s not about what you do; it’s about why clients seek out a firm like yours in the first place.

• Broad enoughto unite your practices under a shared purpose

• Sharp enoughto guide strategic focus, messaging tone, and market identity

This umbrella proposition anchors your brand and ensures consistency across all public-facing communications. Think of it as your North Star.

### Layer Two: Propositions by Use Case or Segment

Once your umbrella is set, the next layer adds practical clarity. Depending on your firm’s business model, that second layer should organize aroundeither:

• Client context/use case(e.g., digital transformation, post-merger integration, international expansion)

• Client segment(e.g., mid-market manufacturers, private-equity-backed firms, regulated industries)

The choice depends on how your clients buy. If they come to you with a problem in mind, use cases may be the better lens. If they come to you because of who they are and what kind of firm you’re built for, segments might make more sense.

### Layer Three: The Counterpart Lens

Whichever option you choose in Layer Two, use the third layer to provide the complementary view. If you went withuse casesin Layer Two, usesegmentsin Layer Three - and vice versa.

This tri-level structure allows you to zoom in and out without losing clarity.

## One Structure, Everywhere

Across all three layers, every proposition should follow a consistent structure. A strong value proposition should answer:

• Why do clients come to us?Your answer here should describe the business issue your service resolves - the very reason why clients call you.

• Who are they, typically?A concise definition of your ideal client and buyer, ideally built upon behavioral traits, not just firmographics.

• What do they struggle with?Descriptions of the jobs clients would have to do to resolve the issue - and the hurdles which get in the way.

• What outcomes can they expect?A summary of the impact you work has - and of the business outcomes it drives

How do we help? Your firm’s point of view on the issue and how it should be solved, plus the client success journey you’ve designed to solve it.

This structure keeps your messaging grounded, specific, and connected across levels. It prevents a fractured story - and helps teams stay aligned on how to talk about the work.

## “Where Do Our Services Go?”

A common question: “If we build all these propositions, what happens to our actual services?”

The answer: they don’t change. Your services can stay as they are, at least for now.

What changes is how those services areframed, packaged, and presented. In one proposition, your transformation work might be framed as modernization; in another, as efficiency. It’s the same delivery, through a different lens.

Think of each proposition layer as afilter- not a menu rewrite.

That said, thereisa way to fully re-design your services once you’ve validated your value proposition, and it might make for a different post some other time. The essence of it is to build services along the client success journey you’ve designed; and it usually works by 1) undbundling your services so you can review the capabilities underpinning them; 2) mapping your capabilities to the client success journey you’ve designed (think: “which of these do clients need at this specific milestone within the journey?”), and then, 3) eventually, re-design them.

*Recommended reading:Why Consulting Value Propositions Must Include a Client Success Journey*

## Top-Down or Bottom-Up: Two Paths to Design

Not every firm starts from the top.

In many cases, a thorough client-and-work review will support atop-downapproach: define a strong umbrella proposition, then cascade more focused sub-propositions below it.

But in other firms - especially those that are diversified or loosely integrated - abottom-uppath works better. You begin by clarifying what each practice, service line, or sector team stands for. Then, you build a unifying umbrella based on what those perspectives share.

Neither model is inherently better. What matters is coherence. The goal is to create a system that aligns your firm’s strategic intent with the actual work you deliver - and helps every part of your business tell the same story, from a slightly different angle.

## A Word of Caution: Discipline Over Diversification

The layered value proposition model is not a license to endlessly expand your service portfolio. Quite the opposite: it’s a framework for focusing your efforts. Each sub-proposition should reinforce, not compete with, the firm-wide umbrella. That means any new offering must be adjacent to your existing strengths, strategically coherent, and clearly aligned to your overall positioning.

Used without discipline, layering risks fragmentation. Over time, you might find yourself with a patchwork of services that confuse clients, dilute your brand, and pull your teams in different directions. Used well, however, the model enforces clarity: it ensures that every additional “layer” enhances the firm's overall value narrative and supports a more unified go-to-market motion.

Hence, and in short: expand with care, and always in service of strategic coherence.

## Case Example: A Sustainability Consultancy

A mid-sized sustainability consultancy operated across three distinct practices: ESG strategy, sustainability communications, and concept engineering (e.g., green buildings, wind farms). While aligned in principle, the three groups struggled to collaborate in practice. Cross-selling was rare, and business development was fragmented - each team selling uphill into its own silo.

That changed when a firm-wide “client-and-work review” surfaced a shared cultural insight: across all three practices, the firm was helping clients treat sustainability as a business opportunity - not just a cost or compliance burden. This conviction became the anchor for a new firm-wide proposition:

“We deliver profitable sustainability solutions.”

From there, the team developed a tiered proposition model:

• Layer 1: A unifying umbrella that expressed the firm’s strategic point-of-view

• Layer 2: Segment propositions based on initiative stages (e.g., Discovery & Strategy, Structuring & Planning, Design & Engineering, Delivery Preparation)

• Layer 3: Use-case propositions tied to investment types (e.g., sustainable real estate, circular products), each adapted for five priority industries

The result: more coherent messaging, better collaboration across teams, and stronger alignment between business development and delivery.

## Closing Thought

A strong value proposition isn’t about slogans - it’s about structure. If your firm serves multiple clients, solves different types of problems, and operates through multiple teams, you need more than a single tagline. You need a system.

When done right, a tiered proposition model doesn’t dilute your message - it sharpens it. It ensures that every part of your firm speaks the same strategic language, while still allowing for the nuance and specificity that great consulting requires.

And most importantly, it helps clients see the full value you can bring, not just the slice they already know.

# The Consulting Value Proposition Quadrant

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 08 April 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/consulting-value-proposition-quadrant

---

In our experience, most consulting firms don’t struggle because of external pressures or poor financials. They don’t have a sales problem. They don’t have an expertise deficit.

They struggle because their consulting value proposition is weak, vague, or indistinguishable from others. Clients don’t feel urgency or see no reason to hire these consultancies.

This foundational problem then rears its ugly head in every aspect of running a consulting business – e.g., marketing efforts seem inconsequential, competitors constantly win bids for ideal clients, the pipeline of work is unpredictable, and so on.

While initial requests for help come to us from consultancies for a whole bunch of reasons, it is amazing how many come down to the problem of poor consulting value propositions.

Over time, it allowed us to map these consulting firms onto a quadrant – the consulting value proposition quadrant.

And that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article: the enormous impact a consulting value proposition has on the success – or lack thereof – of a consulting firm.

## The value proposition challenge that can make or break a consulting firm

While there are countless ways in which a value proposition determines both a long-term strategy of a consulting firm and daily operations, there are six facets that a well-designed consulting value proposition shapes the most:

• It anchors services in a pressing business issue. A strong value proposition ensures that a consulting firm’s services are tied to a high-impact and urgent business challenge, not just a vague or optional improvement. Clients must need the expertise, not merely want it.

• It targets a specific audience/segment. A well-crafted value proposition clearly defines who the consulting firm is ideally equipped to help. Instead of positioning themselves for “any company with a problem,” successful consultancies focus on a well-defined client profile that has the budget and the urgency.

• It defines a clear, outcome-driven impact. A strong value proposition moves beyond broad service messaging like “we do strategy” to articulate specific results – “we solve X problem with Y results”. These consulting firms frame outcomes in a way that resonates with client priorities, showcasing deep expertise and understanding of the specific problems the target audience struggles with.

• It builds on a compelling signature methodology. A repeatable, structured methodology goes a long way in differentiating a consulting firm and enhancing its credibility. Instead of offering generic expertise, high-performing consulting firms develop a proprietary framework and reduce reliance on one-off, fully customised engagements that erode profitability. The result? Predictable outcomes – a massive advantage to offer to risk-averse service buyers.

• It shapes the client success journey. A consulting firm’s value proposition influences the entire client engagement lifecycle. It helps design a journey where value is reinforced at every stage, deepening the relationship and leading to more referrals.

• It informs thought leadership and point of view. A value proposition determines which key themes the consulting firm focuses on in its thought leadership. A strong value proposition helps consulting firms develop a strong, differentiating voice. It helps consultancies become known for solving a specific type of problem, rather than blending into the noise.

*Recommended reading:Building a Winning Consulting Value Proposition*

### Downstream Damage: When the Value Proposition Fails

In the past years, we have observed that when consulting firms get the value proposition wrong, the performance declines in every part of the consultancy.

• Inconsistent client attraction: Client attraction efforts become inconsistent because the messaging of these consulting firms is too broad and fails to resonate with a specific audience. This makes lead generation unpredictable and unreliable.

• Value dilution: When a firm’s vague expertise is wrapped in fluff consulting jargon, it becomes indistinguishable from the rest of the noise. Prospects can’t grasp the firm’s true value. It becomes difficult to justify premium pricing, and consulting firms are forced into a race to the bottom where cost becomes the primary differentiator.

• Lower win rates and longer sales cycles: A weak value proposition leaves too many unanswered questions in the minds of potential clients, leading to hesitation and prolonged decision-making. Clients ask for more proof, additional case studies, and extra meetings before committing, increasing sales cycles.

• Pipeline instability: Without a strong inbound motion, firms become dependent on outbound efforts, constantly chasing new business instead of attracting it. This leads to unpredictable revenue pipelines and inefficient resource allocation. Furthermore, it forces consulting firms into a reactive mode, making it difficult to plan for growth or invest in long-term strategies.

• Constant pricing pressure: When a consulting firm can’t articulate its value clearly, clients evaluate it by simply comparing its pricing to that of other firms. Instead of evaluating expertise and impact, procurement teams treat the firm like a commodity, negotiating with the goal of driving fees down.

• Higher operational complexity: A vague value proposition leads consulting firms to accept too many different types of projects. This variability forces consulting teams to constantly adjust their approach, tools, processes, and methodologies for each engagement. This results in higher costs and wasted resources.

• Lower client retention: When a consulting firm’s value isn’t clearly defined and reinforced throughout the engagement, clients fail to see why they should stay beyond the initial project. Without a structured approach to delivering impact at every stage of the client success journey, consulting firms struggle to deepen relationships, leading to low repeat business and missed opportunities.

• More stress: The lack of a strong value proposition forces firms into survival mode. They are constantly scrambling to win business and justify their fees, which leaves them with no time or resources to intentionally design and execute a strategic growth model.

• Too much customisation: While customisation may seem like a way to add value, it often destroys margins by increasing project complexity, requiring excessive time investment, and making outcomes unpredictable.

• Growth tied to headcount: Without a laser-sharp, differentiating value proposition, firms can only grow by hiring more consultants to take on additional work. This model limits profitability, as revenue is directly linked to the number of billable hours the firm can generate.

## The consulting value proposition quadrant

To help consulting firms understand how they stack up against other consultancies on the market, we have developed a value proposition quadrant.

You can use it to determine where your consultancy’s value proposition sits and what you should do to move to the ideal quadrant.

• Q4: The Gold Standard (Strong Value Proposition + High Need Problem): These firms solve a must-fix issue, and clients see them as the partners to call. Their pricing power is high, and most clients have a budget line item dedicated to solving this problem. Trying to become a highly profitable consulting firm? This quadrant is where you should operate.

• Q3: The Undervalued Expert (Weak Value Proposition + High Need Problem): The problem is real and high stakes, but the firm’s consulting proposition is weak. Clients struggle to see why this firm is the best choice. The opportunity exists, the expertise is there, but the consulting firm is underselling its impact.

• Q2: The Nice-to-Have Club (Strong Value Proposition + Low Need Problem): The offering is sharp and differentiated but doesn’t address an urgent priority. Clients might be interested but don’t have a budget line for it. These consulting firms close deals in good times but struggle when budgets tighten.

• Q1: The Consulting Graveyard (Weak Value Proposition + Low Need Problem): No urgency. No compelling offer. Endless selling cycles, price pressure, and slow-moving deals. These consulting firms spend more time convincing clients that the problem matters than solving it.

### How consulting firms can move into the Gold Standard quadrant

In order to achieve the value proposition that high-performing consultancies operate with, businesses must shift their approach in two critical ways:

• Solve a truly mission-critical problem. Is there a budget line item for solving this issue? If not, it’s not urgent enough. Would inaction result in financial loss, regulatory risk, or competitive decline? If not, reposition. Q4 is about anchoring your value proposition in the most critical challenges the ideal clients face – the types of issues that require immediate solutions rather than optional or incremental improvements.

• Make the value proposition unmissable. Stop selling capabilities and start selling outcomes for specific buyers. Define a sharp, distinct methodology, not another version of what’s already out there. If clients say, “We’ve seen this before,” it's a losing game. Remember that clients aren’t buying frameworks, tools, processes, or experience. They’re buying results that solve their most pressing issues.

### Why now?

“Alright, Luk. This all sounds good, but we don’t see a pressing need to upend our entire business at the moment. Just a couple of tweaks will suffice.”

I heard this type of response more than once.

Unfortunately, time is not a luxury that most consulting firms can afford.

Here's what Florian and I observe:

• The market is getting more competitive every week.

• The battle for attention has dramatically intensified.

• The AI hype fuels additional hesitation.

• Decision-making is slower.

• Budgets are scrutinised.

But the most significant risk is internal. Consulting firms that lack a compelling, must-have proposition will suffer more.

Most consulting firms never fully commit to a differentiated value proposition. They tweak it, water it down, remain deliberately vague, chase short-term revenue, and end up stuck in the wrong quadrant.

Winning is about owning the Q4, solving a critical problem, and resisting the pull to dilute the consultancy’s proposition.

*Recommended reading:The Biggest Mistakes Consulting Firms Made in 2024*

## Final thoughts: Mediocrity doesn’t fuel growth

In a market that is only getting more competitive, a value proposition can determine whether a consulting firm is thriving or barely surviving.

Consultancies that fail to commit to a strong, differentiating value proposition that reflects the urgent problems of a narrowly defined audience will continue to struggle, chasing unpredictable deals and fighting constant price pressure.

On the other hand, consulting firms that design their way into the Q4 quadrant by anchoring themselves in an urgent problem will enjoy growth, not just revenue growth but profitability growth.

The question is: where does your consulting firm sit today? Are you surviving in default mode, or did you intentionally design the consulting proposition for high performance?

# Why Outdated Websites Signal Bigger Problems in Consulting Firms

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 25 March 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-outdated-websites-signal-bigger-problems-in-consulting-firms

---

"Luk, don’t assess our website because it’s outdated…"

We hear this a lot when we review consulting firms. According to them, their website doesn’t matter because:

• “We win work through relationships, not marketing.”

• “Consulting clients don’t buy from websites.”

• “We don’t have time to update the site.”+ a dozen other reasons along the same lines

Unfortunately, we’ve observed that an outdated website isn't just a website problem. More often than not, it’s a symptom of a fundamental consulting business problem.

In our experience, unclear digital presence usually signals more profound strategic challenges – underlying challenges that will sink the entire ship sooner or later. And that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article.

## Digital presence does matter to consulting service buyers!

Gone are the days when business development involved cold calls and endless email follow-ups. If you ask me, that's good riddance!

Here are a few findings on how buyers go about their search these days:

• B2B buyers do their homework. 75% of buyers prefer to gather information before they buy on their own, according toresearch by Hubspot.

• Furthermore, astudy by Hinge(an agency specialising in Professional Service Firm marketing) uncovered that general web search is the second most common method for buyers to search for work-related topics (asking peers or colleagues for a recommendation being #1).

• Finally, anEdelman-LinkedIn studyfound that 54% of decision-makers and C-suite executives say that an organisation that consistently produces high-quality thought leadership content has prompted them to research its offers or capabilities.

There are many more findings across various studies that point to the same reality:service buyers are paying attention to the digital presence of firms. It can be in the form of reading their thought leadership content, checking out their service offering on the website, reviewing the profile of the leadership team, reading case studies and testimonials, browsing through outcomes that can be achieved, coming across their websites through pain point-based search queries, etc.

Often, a consulting firm’s website is the first point of interaction a prospect has with the consulting firm. That’s a massive opportunity, or it is an enormous loss in instances where the website is vague and outdated.

## 5 reasons why a vague website hurts a consulting firm more than it seems

An outdated or vague website typically points to deeper issues that can hinder a consulting firm's growth, credibility, and efficiency.

### #1. Prospects don’t read intent, they read what’s there

Prospects judge what they see, whether a consulting firm likes it or not. If the messaging is unclear, so is the firm's strategic positioning.

If things were well-defined internally, they would have made it onto the website. It’s not a matter of limited resources. Even the most non-tech-savvy person can update the site's text.

From everything we’ve observed over the years, a lack of clarity online often reflects a lack of clarity in practice. And prospects don’t like it when clarity is missing. They try to minimise risk, which means they are looking for some form of assurance that engaging a particular consultancy will deliver reliable ROIs.

### #2. Internal teams struggle to sell what isn’t clearly defined

A vague website creates internal confusion. If a consulting firm’s team can’t articulate who they serve, what problem they solve, what outcomes can be achieved, and how they do it differently - essential website components, how can they sell it?

This lack of internal unity in the sales efforts forces senior leaders – who can (hopefully) explain it – into business development mode without much support from the rest of the team. As a result, growth depends on these few people, and the consultancy fails to establish a scalable, repeatable sales model.

A website is an asset. Marketing and sales teams rely on it as a foundation for their efforts. Sure, they can communicate much of the value through calls, emails, neatly designed capabilities statements, etc.

Unfortunately, they often feel embarrassed that they have to point prospects to their outdated website as the main digital asset.

### #3. Internal misalignment pulls consultancies in different directions

Internal misalignment shows up in external messaging. Updating a website is typically more than just a job for graphic designers and web developers. It’s an exercise in crystalising the vision, the value proposition, the target audience, and the service offering.

A vague website makes the lack of internal alignment obvious. It signals a disconnect among senior leaders regarding who the consulting firm caters to, its strengths, how it delivers value to clients, and what past engagements exemplify this delivery excellence.

### #4. Vague websites fail to generate quality leads

The relationships-focused approach to business development is an outdated strategy. Nothing showed its fragility quite as much as global lockdowns in 2020-2021. However, even before the global pandemic, the wine-and-dine strategy was on its way out.

High-performing consultancies realised a decade ago that consulting buyers’ behaviour was shifting. They were increasingly starting their purchasing journey by doing their own research, looking into consultancies, reading their thought leadership content, and evaluating their digital presence to get a sense of their trustworthiness.

This trend has been on the rise ever since. And sure, purchasing consulting services is a more complex process than ordering a sweater from Amazon. The buyers’ journey is longer and typically involves multiple stakeholders. However, it doesn’t negate the simple reality: prospects are paying attention to their potential business partners’ digital presence and drawing conclusions.

Vague websites fail to peak prospects’ interests. They fail to generate leads that can then be developed into clients. That’s a massive missed opportunity.

### #5. Talent attraction becomes harder

It’s not just prospects who check out consulting firms’ websites. Potential employees do, too.

Before joining, top consulting talent wants to know exactly how their expertise fits into a firm's value proposition. They also want to understand a consulting firm’s approach to engaging clients as an indicator of what is expected of team members.

Potential hires struggle to connect their skills if a firm’s proposition is broad and unclear. Furthermore, many see it as a signal of a chaotic work culture that fails to define processes, responsibilities, and expectations clearly.

## Assessing your consulting firm's website quality

We use a simple quadrant to help consulting firms reflect on the quality of their website across two dimensions:

• Clarity of the Consulting Proposition (specificity of the value):How clearly does the firm articulate who it serves, what business issue it solves, to what end, and through what distinct approach?

• Strength of Digital Presence (business generation power):Is the website built to generate traffic and business based on that proposition? Is it designed with a clear target audience in mind, and does it convert interest into meaningful engagement?

• Q1:Default Firm(Vague Positioning + Weak Digital Presence)Outdated site, generic services, no clear focusFluff proposition full of jargon and consulting BSLacks credibility and differentiationEasily ignored or dismissed by prospects

• Q2: Invisible Expert (Clear Positioning + Weak Digital Presence)Strong firm hidden behind a weak or outdated siteGreat IP and value—but not visible onlineMissed opportunitiesMisaligned or underwhelmed prospects

• Outdated site, generic services, no clear focus

• Fluff proposition full of jargon and consulting BS

• Lacks credibility and differentiation

• Easily ignored or dismissed by prospects

• Strong firm hidden behind a weak or outdated site

• Great IP and value—but not visible online

• Missed opportunities

• Misaligned or underwhelmed prospects

• Q3: Attraction Mask (Vague Positioning + Strong Digital Presence)Website looks modern and polishedBut the proposition is vague, generic and interchangeableHigh bounce ratesShiny surface, no substance

• Website reinforces value proposition and authority

• Converts. Elevates. Accelerates.

## Key takeaway: Updating a website is an opportunity to refine the consulting proposition

We've learned that outdated websites often reflect internal strategy discussions. A website is a mirror of how a consulting firm sees itself.

If it’s outdated, it’s often because the consulting firm hasn’t defined its value proposition sharply enough to update it. If the consulting proposition isn’t clear, the firm will likely lose deals to competitors who make it easier for clients to say yes.

So yes, maybe it’s 'just' a website. But in our experience, more often than not, it’s also the outcome of a foundational internal discussion about strategy (where do we focus, what’s our ‘swim lane’?) and value proposition specificity.

When was the last time you checked whether your firm’s consulting proposition was as sharp externally as it is in the head of the partners or leaders?

The best part of updating a website is that it forces consulting leaders to have a discussion and answer questions like:

• “Whose interest are we trying to gauge with the website?”

• “What are the problems that these audience members facing that we could highlight on the website?”

• “What makes us different?”

• “What do we want prospects to think of us when they go through our site?”

• “What value are we claiming to deliver?”

So, I invite consulting firms to review their websites and assess the extent to which these digital assets accurately portray their self-image and build a high degree of trust for the prospect.

# Want More Clients? Stop Talking About Your Expertise!

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs

---

Earlier this year, we had an awkward conversation with a consulting firm that proudly claimed to be experts in Lean Management.

We challenged them: “Who is actually looking for Lean Management?” They hesitated.

The truth is that no one wakes up thinking, “We need more Lean.” Clients do not have a Lean problem; they have a productivity issue, a supply chain bottleneck, or an operational inefficiency. Lean is merely one potential approach to resolving these issues.

But by leading with "We are lean experts (and shouting into the void: "Who needs lean management?"), like almost all other consulting firms, this firm was making a critical mistake: they were selling a capability, not a solution to a specific problem for a well-defined target audience.

In this article, I want to discuss in more depth why consulting firms should rethink and shift their focus from selling expertise to selling solutions to high-stakes problems.

## Selling capabilities vs problem resolutions: What’s the difference?

Let us return to our example for a moment. The consulting firm, in our view, asked the wrong question. They were inquiring of prospects: “Who requires Lean?” A more compelling question would have been, “Who needs improved operational efficiency?”

We advised them to focus on:

• the business issue…

• for a specific target audience...

• with a clear outcome…

• with Lean as the supporting methodology.

What would that look like? Something like this: “We help international manufacturing companies reduce supply chain costs by typically between X and Y% using a Lean approach.”

This is just an example from a recent conversation. We encounter this consulting 'illness' (poor value propositions) daily with capabilities-focused terminology front and centre: AI, Agile, Digital, PPM, Autonomous, Sustainability, ESG, and hundreds more.Recommended reading:The Biggest Mistakes Consulting Firms Made in 2024

### Clients want to solve their problems

We frequently recommend that consulting firms examine their sales strategies in light of their own daily consumer behaviour.

For example, say you have a plumbing issue: a pipe bursts due to cold weather. You turn off the water and call a plumber. Do you ask this person to list all the tools they have at their disposal? No, not really. You don’t care. You want your everyday life back: to be able to do laundry, wash dishes, and take a shower.

Most of us won’t even be able to name more than a handful of tools we expect to see in a plumber’s toolbox. In this instance, you are looking for a specialist with a proven track record (positive reviews from past customers) of fixing broken pipes efficiently and durably. That’s all.

The same logic and natural way of human behaviour apply to the consulting industry. Clients don’t care what skills a consultancy has in its toolbox – not at first. They want a partner who will solve headache-inducing problems and the guarantee that this partner will succeed.

Don’t get us wrong. Consulting expertise is essential. It allows a consulting firm to make bold statements like “We help reduce operational costs by 30% within six months” and back them up with a track record of delivering that value.

However, expertise is a tool. It’s a capability. It means nothing without a real problem (explained in a value proposition)!

## Oh, there are two sorts of possible clients

Most companies already have CRM, ERP, Cloud, and other solutions or tools. Of course, they all want to maximize the use and ROI of the systems or approaches they have in place.

However, systems that are supposed to facilitate processes and make operations more efficient often act as bottlenecks due to a lack of adoption, incorrect implementation, or other reasons.

Consulting firms could improve their commercial effectiveness by ALSO targeting clients who already have a solution but are not achieving the expected ROI.

However, also here, screaming “We are CRM experts” will not get a consulting firm far enough in these instances. Once again, clients don’t care, and this messaging won’t even register on their radar.

But what if the consulting firm, instead, focuses on the problem that these prospects are facing:

• 50-60% of companies struggle to see ROI from their CRM investment…

• Sales teams don’t use it properly, data is messy, and reporting is unreliable…

• Leadership questioned whether the investment was even worth it…

Now, the consulting firm’s value proposition and the resulting messaging have an ‘open door’.

Instead of saying 'We are CRM experts', they now address real trigger points:

• “Is your CRM failing to deliver the sales lift you expected?”

• “Are your reps bypassing the system because it slows them down?”

• “Is leadership frustrated with incomplete and inaccurate reports?”

The ideal approach for consulting firms is to distinguish between two target audiences:

• Buyers seeking to solve a problem: The consulting firm focuses on solving their problem(s).

• Buyers who already have a solution: The consulting firm focuses on maximising the ROI of an existing solution or approach.

In both instances, we strongly suggest that consulting firms focus on the problem they promise to solve. Because the trigger points for the two groups are different, consultancies’ value propositions should be different when targeting these two audiences. Very few consulting firms make this difference.

Without a clear distinction, firms risk losing relevance with both groups.

*Recommended reading:Building a Winning Consulting Value Proposition*

## Selling outcomes, not capabilities: why now?

We sometimes hear from consultancies that they want to shift from their current "capability-selling" strategy—where they offer raw expertise and often deliver bespoke engagements—to a more proposition- and outcome-selling stance. But they’re "not sure if they’re ready yet."That's okay, of course. We never tell them they might be running out of time. It’s not our style, and we don't believe in pressuring people that way.But honestly? We don't believe the runway for "classical" consulting is getting shorter. And the market? Whether firms feel "ready" or not, it's already moving on.Software and AI have been tackling the same business challenges that consultancies used to solve for a while now, offering highly specific, outcome-focused solutions at a fraction of the price.And with a now heightened slowdown in most service markets, firms are feeling the pinch even harder.Combine these pressures and consider how expertsexpect consulting growth rates to stay sluggish, and it’s clear: This isn’t the time to cling to old ways and hope things "get better." (see our article:'Consulting Growth Is Stalling, How Can You Respond?')In this environment, sticking with capability selling just isn’t cutting it.Clients aren’t looking to buy expertise anymore; they want outcomes—specific solutions to specific problems with clear, achievable results.

So firms will likely see their troubles worsen if they cannot make a clear, compelling business case for hiring them.

## Our recommendation

If we ran a "classical" consulting firm today and saw inquiries slowing and utilization dropping, we’d focus our now-free resources on four critical things:1. Refining value propositions– moving beyond broad capabilities to create sharp, outcome-focused offers that speak to clients' real issues at the firm, service group, and service level.2. Innovating services– investing in solutions that increase client value and improve delivery (Why not leverage software and AI?).3. Validating offers– putting new propositions before friends, prospects, and clients to test resonance. We’d even deliver a few services at "trial pricing" to build real-world delivery experience.4. Systematizing go-to-market and delivery– many firms still have work to do in refining their bizdev and client service processes. Do this work, but do it for the new propositions and services after you've validated them.And no, this isn’t about tweaks. It’s about structural change - ensuring the firm’s strategy is fit for the current market.Because if there’s one thing we are sure of, it’s this: the market isn’t going to wait for anyone to be ready... and what made firms successful in the past won’t necessarily carry them forward.How do they say? The second-best time to revise your strategy is ...... now.

# The AI Hype in Consulting: Time for Specificity, Not Buzzwords

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 07 March 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/ai-hype-in-consulting-time-for-specificity-not-buzzwords

---

"We reinvent your company with AI." "Unlocking AI's potential in your business." "Navigating the enterprise AI landscape."

Consulting firms, both those enhancing business problem-solving with AI and those specializing in AI technology implementation, are flooding the market with vague, overpromising language.

But the AI hype has reached saturation, and clients are increasingly skeptical.

The explosion of AI interest since early 2023 has created two distinct types of consulting firms in this space:

• Business-centric consultingfirms address fundamental business challenges (e.g., supply chain risk reduction, innovation optimisation, sustainability compliance advisory, customer experience and service optimisation, etc.). They increasingly incorporate AI into their methodologies, processes, and service delivery. AI enhances these firms' problem-solving approach rather than being the cornerstone of their value proposition.

• Technology-Centric AI Consulting Firms: These firms specialise in the technical implementation and adoption of AI tools and technologies. While they are consulting firms rather than software vendors, their expertise lies in AI integration, deployment, and ensuring that enterprises can effectively adopt and utilise AI solutions.

Both types of consulting firms frequently fall into the trap of vague AI-driven messaging, failing to articulate a clear, issue-led, outcome-based value proposition. To remain relevant and credible, they must substantially refine their consulting proposition and language.

## Business-Centric Consulting Firms: AI as an Enabler, Not the Story

Many business-centric consulting firms are bolting AI onto their existing services, but few can clearly articulate its impact. Clients aren’t buying AI—they’re buying solutions to pressing business problems or opportunities.

Yet, value propositions like “We transform your business with AI” say nothing concrete about the actual problems being solved.

C-level leaders aren’t looking for another firm that "leverages AI." They need partners who can diagnose and solve their most critical business challenges and opportunities, whether AI is involved or not.

A better way to position AI-enabled expertise would be:

• Instead of: "We optimize your supply chain with AI-driven insights."

• Say: "We help enterprises reduce supply chain risk by 30% by using AI to predict supplier disruptions and optimize inventory buffers."

• Instead of: "We accelerate business transformation through AI."

• Say: "We cut operational costs by 25% by embedding AI-enabled process automation into high-friction workflows."

The emphasis should be on the measurable business impact, not the tools employed to achieve it.

Overemphasising AI risks undermining their consulting reputation and diminishing the strategic expertise that clients genuinely value.

*Recommended reading:There Are Two Ways to Run a Consulting Firm. One Drains Profitability.*

## Technology-Centric AI Consulting Firms: More Than Implementation

Technology-focused AI consulting firms encounter a different issue: They frequently promote AI adoption without adequately defining the business case. Many highlight their technical capabilities instead of their capacity to deliver significant business outcomes.

Clients do not require additional AI vendors; they seek strategic partners who can elucidate AI’s role in their business, showcase proven use cases, and enhance AI literacy to facilitate better AI-related decision-making.

Generic consulting propositions such as "We are AI experts helping enterprises integrate cutting-edge AI technologies" are devoid of meaning without specificity. A more effective approach would be:

• Instead of: "We integrate AI into modern enterprises."

• Say: "We reduce fraud detection time by 40% by deploying AI-powered anomaly detection in financial transactions."

• Instead of: "We help companies adopt AI."

• Say: "We guide enterprises through AI adoption by identifying high-impact use cases, mitigating risks, and ensuring regulatory compliance."

Aside from the messaging issue, most technology-focused AI companies overlook a fundamental truth: AI adoption is not merely about implementation but also about guaranteeing business impact. This involves providing clients with:

• A clear business case for AI adoption—why it matters, what problems it solves, and how it ties into broader strategic objectives.

• Proven use casesrelevant to their industry, showing measurable outcomes and ROI.

• AI literacy developmentfor executives, enabling them to make informed decisions about AI investments and implementation roadmaps.

Without these, AI services become a technical exercise with little executive buy-in or strategic value.

## Consulting Firms Need to Recognize Two Distinct AI Buyer Segments

Both business-centric and technology-centred AI consulting firms make a common error: assuming that all AI buyers have identical needs. In reality, AI adoption follows varied trajectories, and consulting firms must refine their value proposition accordingly.

There are two primary buyer segments:

• New AI Buyers: Companies that are exploring AI for the first time. They require education on potential use cases, strategic alignment, and clear guidance on adopting AI without unnecessary risk or distractions from business as usual.

• Experienced AI Users: Companies that have experimented with AI but encountered challenges such as failed pilots, insufficient ROI, or ineffective implementation. They require assistance in optimising AI for more significant business impact or regaining internal trust in its capabilities.

Each group has distinct concerns and decision-making triggers. Yet, most consulting firms lump them together under generic AI messaging. This is a fundamental oversight.

• For New Buyers: “We help enterprises identify high-impact AI opportunities, build a roadmap, and ensure smooth adoption without disrupting core operations.”

• For Experienced Users: “We diagnose and rectify failing AI initiatives, ensuring they provide more measurable business value or ROI and are seamlessly integrated into operational workflows.” Alternatively: "We specialise in identifying the most effective industry-related use cases, informed by the client's existing AI experiences.”

By recognizing these different needs, consulting firms—whether business-centric or technology-centric—can shift from generic AI evangelism to offering real strategic value. Without a clear distinction in messaging, firms risk losing relevance with both groups.

*Recommended reading:Building a Winning Consulting Value Proposition*

## Conclusion. The AI Consulting Market Needs a Reality Check

The AI hype in consulting has reached its peak, and clients are growing weary. Both business-centric and technology-centric consulting firms must stop hiding behind AI buzzwords and get laser-focused on articulating why their expertise matters and what business problems they solve.

• AI is not the story. Business outcomes are.

• Generic AI promises are meaningless without proven use cases and tangible ROI.

• Clients need partners who can leverage or implement AI and help them make better decisions, improve processes, etc., with AI or about AI.

The competition in AI consulting is intense. To distinguish themselves, firms must go beyond vague, self-promotional AI jargon and establish trust and credibility through clear, audience-specific value propositions that tackle tangible business challenges and provide measurable results.

The hype fades. Expertise endures. Time to get specific.

## Most consulting firms get this wrong – and it’s costing them

“What is your consultancy’s value proposition?” I ask this in almost every introductory call with a consulting firm owner or leader. The answer tells me everything I need to know about the firm’s positioning, maturity, and likelihood of sustained growth.

And here’s what I’ve observed from years of working in the trenches with consulting firms:

• Some launch into afive-minute monologueabout their services, years of experience, and methodologies. Translation?They don’t have a client-centric value proposition.They’re selling credentials, not outcomes—leading to lower win rates and price pressure.

• Others insist their value propositiondepends on the prospect’s unique needs(huh?).. These firms try to be everything to everyone. In reality, they are trapped in arace to the bottom, constantly competing on price.

• Then, there’s the most troubling response:complete silence. The respondents have no idea how to answer the question, which usually signals a deeper issue—a lack of strategic direction and intentional design.

• Occasionally, I get acrisp, powerful responsethat, in under a minute, tells me exactly what problems the firm solves, for whom, and what results it delivers. These firms are on the right track—they don’t need reinvention, just fine-tuning.

The vast majority of consultancies fall into the first three categories. And that’s why, again and again, we start our work in the same place:fixing their value proposition.

In this article, I’d like to share a straightforward value proposition design approach thatFlorian Heinrichsand I co-created and apply in our work with consulting firm clients.I aim to explain that value proposition design is a manageable process. It’s about thoroughly–and honestly!–examining what a consulting firm does and how it does it, evaluating how closely the consultancy’s offering matches the prospects' needs, and then crystallising the learnings into an impactful definition.

## A strong value proposition drives profitability. A weak one destroys it

Here’s the hard truth: a vague or generic value proposition is not just a marketing problem. It’s a profitability problem.

Firms with weak value propositions experience:

• Lower win rates: They struggle to convince clients why they’re the right choice, leading to constant pitching and long sales cycles.

• Pricing pressure: Without a clear, differentiated promise, they end up in pricing battles with competitors.

• High operational complexity: They take on too many different types of projects, creating inefficiencies and lower margins.

• Growth stagnation: Without clarity on their positioning, these firms plateau, stuck in reactive mode rather than scaling intentionally.

On the flip side, consulting firms that invest in sharpening their value proposition benefit from:

• Stronger client attraction: The right clients recognize the firm as the best fit for their challenges.

• Premium pricing: Clients pay for perceived expertise and clarity, not just effort.

• Repeatability and scalability: With a well-defined scope, delivery becomes more efficient and profitable.

If your firm is experiencing pricing struggles, inconsistent sales, or operational chaos, the root cause is likely a vague, diluted, or non-existent value proposition.

*Recommended reading:The Biggest Mistakes Consulting Firms Made in 2024*

## No silver bullet. Value proposition design requires commitment

Most consulting firms skip this step entirely or rush through it with vague, high-level statements. Some founders piece together a value proposition by listing services and generic differentiators, hoping it will be enough. It won’t.

Getting this right isn’t a one-day exercise. It requires stepping back, reviewing past projects, interviewing past clients, and distilling real-world insights into a crisp, compelling narrative. It demands introspection, iteration, and honesty—and many firms resist that level of scrutiny.

But here’s the reality: if you want to win premium clients and scale profitably, there’s no shortcut. A weak, ad-hoc value proposition keeps your firm stuck in reactive, headcount-driven growth. A well-designed one enables repeatability, margin expansion, and authority positioning.

## The value proposition canvas – a no-nonsense approach

To cut through the noise, Florian Heinrichs and I developed a Value Proposition Canvas tailored specifically for consulting firms or consulting practices. We use it in our project work because it forces clarity, strips away the fluff, and helps firms articulate their value compellingly and practically.

Here’s how it works:

• Our best clients come to us because…(The high-level problem you solve.)

• They typically are…(The industry, company types, and roles you target.)

• They struggle with…(The specific pain points that make them seek help.)

• They can expect [X] from us…(The measurable outcomes they can expect.)

• Here’s how we help…(The structured, high-level approach to solving the problem.)

Once completed, this canvas becomes a strategic tool for the website, pitches, business development, client selection, and operational decision-making. It also informs the consulting firm's thought leadership strategy.

As Florian often says in client engagements, the value proposition isn’t just about messaging—it’s about a consulting firm's entire identity.

## Examples of value propositions designed based on the canvas

To further help consulting firms picture the final destination of the value proposition design process, I’d like to offer a few examples of what this could look like.

### Example 1: A data analytics consulting firm (focus: supermarket chains)

• Our best clients come to us because their sales forecasting process delivers inaccurate results.

• They typically are Sales Leaders, COOs, or Chief Supply Chain leaders of multinational supermarket chains, with important stakeholders such as CFO, CIO, Inventory & Warehouse leaders, and Category leaders.

• They usually lack internal expertise on what data points must be considered and which advanced models can be made operational and provide the most reliable outcomes.

• They can expect us to design a more accurate sales forecasting system that, on average, reduces costs by 5-10% and delivers forecasts with >90% accuracy.

• Our client work usually involves a feasibility study - a comprehensive assessment of existing forecasting processes, available data sources, and technology infrastructure - followed by a 4-6 months engagement encompassing data cleaning & integration, model selection, testing/piloting, and implementation/operationalization.

### Example 2: A digital marketing consultancy (focus: international e-commerce)

• Our best clients come to us because their digital advertising ROI is low.

• They are typically senior marketing officers of large international e-commerce brands with sizable advertising budgets.

• They usually struggle with the lack of knowledge of the latest digital advertising best practices and optimisation strategies.

• We help our clients develop internal capabilities to set up cost-effective digital advertising campaigns that increase ROI by 30-50% on average.

• Our work with clients typically starts with an audit of their current digital advertising strategies and performance, leading to developing a customised, effective digital advertising strategy. We then facilitate the hands-on implementation of this strategy, including campaign setup, content development, performance monitoring, and real-time optimisation. We also provide comprehensive training to the client's marketing teams, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to manage and refine their campaigns independently in the future. The engagement concludes with a detailed review of results and recommendations for ongoing improvements, ensuring we boost their immediate ROI and build their capacity to sustain these gains over time.

### Example 3: A strategy consulting firm (focus: regional publishers)

• Clients come to us because they want to diversify their publishing revenue streams.

• These are typically chief revenue officers at regional news publications and online platforms.

• They typically struggle with their lack of expertise in setting up paywall-based and advertising-based revenue strategies, and their past experiences with trying to set them up on their own have resulted in significant drops in user engagement.

• They expect us to identify the bottlenecks of their unsuccessful attempts to diversify their revenue streams and create internal stakeholder alignment around a roadmap that enables them to launch and successfully grow the new streams within 6-12 months.

• Our client engagements start with an audit identifying bottlenecks in prior revenue diversification efforts. We then co-develop a data-driven roadmap for revenue diversification tailored to each client's unique context. Our roadmap integrates paywall and advertising strategies while considering user engagement. We drive internal alignment through workshops, and with our continuous support, we empower clients to successfully grow their new revenue streams within 6-12 months.

### Example 4: A sales consultancy (focus: enterprise software)

• Clients come to us because of their poor sales closing rate.

• They are typically national and regional sales leaders of large enterprise software vendors.

• They find themselves investing increasingly more resources into the sales process just to maintain the same level of sales revenue.

• We help our clients diagnose the root of the problem and modernise their sales process, consistently resulting in a 20-40% cost reduction in sales and typically a 10-20% increase in sales revenue in Year 1.

• We typically start by analyzing their current sales processes and performance metrics in depth. We identify the underlying issues contributing to low closing rates and high sales costs. Leveraging our extensive enterprise sales expertise, we design and implement a modernised, efficient sales process tailored to their needs. This includes streamlining sales operations, enhancing training, and integrating advanced sales tools. With our ongoing support and monitoring, clients can reduce sales costs by 20-40% and increase sales revenue by 10-20% in the first year.

All of these examples are relatively easy to process. They deliver the most valuable information to a prospect in under a minute. They explain who, why, what, and how. This is where owners and leaders of consulting firms should aim to end upon completing their value proposition design process.Every statement in the value propositions above requires careful consideration and analysis, gathering information, interviewing past clients and prospects, comparing the financial outcomes of past projects, looking at cost optimisation opportunities, and so on.

These value proposition statements do not come together out of thin air.

## Final thought: stop improvising. Start designing

If you’re running a consulting firm without a defined, intentional value proposition, you’re leaving money on the table. Worse, you’re making it harder than it needs to be: harder to sell, harder to price well, harder to scale.

High-performing firms don’t just react to opportunities. They design their success. They:

• Define a differentiated, outcome-specific value proposition.(They solve a well-defined business issue with precision.)

• Narrow their targeting.(They attract the right clients, reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.)

• Standardise & refine their processes.(They lower costs and improve quality.)

• Scale strategically.(Growth is repeatable and efficient, not headcount-driven.)

If your consulting firm is stuck in capability selling, pricing pressure, or inconsistent sales cycles, the issue isn’t a marketing problem. It’s a design problem. And the solution starts with getting your value proposition right.

There are two ways to run a consulting firm: Improvisation or Intention. The choice is yours.

# Consulting Growth Is Stalling – How Can You Respond?

"2024 wasn’t a great year for consulting." That’s the bottom line from the latest Consulting Market Navigator report by Kennedy Intelligence and the IMF.

AsNathan Simon, partner at Kennedy Intelligence, points out, consulting growth outpaced nominal GDP in the early 2010s. That trend slowed in the late 2010s and briefly rebounded in 2021–2022, but has now faded. His take:

"Unfortunately, the double-digit growth rates of 2021–22 were a one-off… as talent-strapped clients grappled with supply and business model disruptions."

I haven’t run the numbers like Kennedy Intelligence, but from my own work with mid-sized boutiques and larger firms, I see the same trend: Winning and growing work is getting harder, and the rules of the sector are shifting.

Most critically,the old ways of building and growing a consulting firm are under pressure. It’s time to move beyond the capability-plus-capacity stance.

## In search of a more compelling proposition

Many consultancies still sell primarily on capability:

"We know how to do [X]… Who here needs [X]?"

This worked when clients had more need for “advisory services” - and fewer substitute solutions. But today, that model is breaking down for two key reasons:

1️⃣Clients are more cautious. Kennedy Intelligence’s research shows that executives are hesitant to make big bets. Discretionary spending is under scrutiny… meaning “advisory” is, too.

2️⃣Alternative solutions are everywhere. AI and software providers now promise "consulting as software” at a fraction of the cost. Whether these claims are valid or not, when client executives see tech offering similar-sounding solutions, consulting firms must work harder to justify their fees.

But the real challenge isn’t just external, of course: It’s internal and, yes, self-inflicted.

If your pitch is "We have deep expertise in [X]" – without linking it to a pressing business issue and a clear, high-value outcome – you’re not giving clients a compelling reason to hire you.

Consulting buyers have never cared about your skills in isolation. They care about how quickly and reliably you can solve a business problem. And today, they’re scrutinizing that harder than ever.

Yet most consulting firms are still structured aroundcapability selling. The result?

🚧Too much focus on expertise and capacity. Firms describe what they do rather than the specific outcomes they drive.🚧Too few compelling value propositions. Most pitches lack the clarity and rigor of an investment banker's deal presentation.🚧Not enough well-defined client success journeys. Many firms operate without a structured methodology linking client issues to measurable impact.

In my view, this is why so many firms are feeling the pressure—there simply aren’t enough clear, compellingbusiness casesfor hiring them. Unless firms shift their approach, that pressure will only increase.

## Time to create a higher-performing, more resilient firm

If your firm’s growth is stalling, it’s time to rethink how you position your expertise. The shift?

📌 From selling capability to solving high-value business problems.📌 From pitching expertise to crafting a clear, compelling business case for why hiring your firm is a strategic move.📌 From reactive client-chasing to intentional, repeatable business development.

Here’s how to get started:

1️⃣Define the specific, high-stakes business issue you solve. Clients don’t buy expertise - they buy solutions to expensive, urgent problems. Make sure yours is clearly articulated.

2️⃣Formalize the client journey to success. Map out a structured, repeatable process that links client issues to tangible business outcomes. This will make your work easier to buy and command higher fees.

3️⃣Build a thought leadership and business development engine. A compelling proposition is only valuable if the right people see it. Invest in systematic outreach rather than relying on word-of-mouth or sporadic networking.

By taking these steps, you create propositions that make itdifficult for ideal clients to say no- and that protects your consulting firm from market pressures, order-taking, internal chaos, and complexity cost.

## A new imperative for consulting leaders

If you’re leading growth at a mid-sized boutique or working toward senior partner at a larger firm, you must take this shift seriously. That means investing the time, effort, and strategic capital to build a business case for your firm that stands out.

I’ve seen firsthand how high-performing firms make this transition. The results? More substantial differentiation, better clients, and a more resilient business model - one that isn’t at the mercy of market cycles.

The firms that thrive in the next 24 months will move beyond selling capability and start selling solutions with intention.

If your consulting firm is facing headwinds, ask yourself:🧐Are we selling expertise - or solving a high-value problem?🧐Do our clients see us as an investment - or an expense?

The answers will determine whether your firm grows - or stalls - in the years ahead.

# Adopting the Buyer’s Lens to Improve Consultancy Performance

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 24 January 2025

---

Having spent years working with consulting firm buyers, I’ve documented what I’ve learned to provide readers with an additional perspective—what I call ‘the buyer’s lens.’ This isn’t a framework or an exhaustive list, but rather a collection of my experiences and observations about what buyers value most when assessing consulting firms.

I want to share these insights to help consulting firm leaders look at their businesses from this perspective. By doing so, they can uncover opportunities to strengthen their firm’s performance, long-term resilience, and market value.

## 1. Foundational Financial Health: Reliable Profits and Financials

Understanding the P&L remains critical—yet many consulting firm leaders fail to engage with their financials truly.

In my experience, many owners and partners lack detailed insight into their financial metrics. For some, financial monitoring is limited to an annual review when the accountant closes the books, treating it as a compliance exercise rather than a management tool.

Even in firms with substantial revenue, I’ve observed leaders who don’t track gross margins weekly or lack a clear cash flow forecast. This disconnect often leads to missed opportunities and blind spots in operational efficiency.

What surprises me most is how often these firms—which pride themselves on advising others—overlook their financial mastery. Without deep understanding and regular monitoring of key metrics, leaders cannot steer their firms with the precision needed to thrive. This oversight weakens their ability to steer the business effectively and raises red flags for potential buyers.

If you’re not deeply familiar with your consultancy’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow, it’s time to prioritise financial literacy or get external coaching. Financial clarity is non-negotiable for running a successful consultancy.

The buyer’s lens reveals additional financial metrics that signal a consultancy’s stability and attractiveness:

• Consistent profit: Buyers look for steady earnings. Volatility in profitability is a red flag, whereas consistency signals strong financial management.

• Clean Financials: Well-documented and easy-to-understand financial records inspire confidence. Disorganised books or unclear documentation can deter buyers.

• Clear Cash Flow and Forecasting: Reliable cash flow projections for 26 to 52 weeks demonstrate control over financial operations and the ability to plan effectively.

• Project Gross Margins: Weekly follow-up on project gross margins ensures financial performance is monitored and optimised.

• Management Reporting: Weekly updates on key financial metrics indicate proactive leadership and operational transparency.

Firms with these practices stand out as financially resilient and well-prepared for future growth, making them more appealing to potential buyers.

*Recommended reading:The One Boutique Consultancy Metric That Tells It All*

## 2. Market Position and Growth Potential

Consulting proposition clarity and expertise reputation remain central, but the buyer’s lens expands on these concepts.

In my work with buyers, I’ve noticed their unwavering focus on identifying firms that stand out as market leaders. Buyers favour firms that are recognized as:

• Go-To Expertise Destination: Buyers prioritize firms seen as a “reference” in their market—trusted authorities known for solving specific, high-stakes problems. I’ve seen how firms with niche expertise and strong reputations can command premium valuations.

• Barriers to Entry: Signature methodologies, honed over the years, create competitive moats that are hard for competitors to replicate. Buyers often emphasize the importance of these unique approaches as key differentiators.

• Proven Scalability: Buyers scrutinize revenue-per-FTE metrics to assess scalability. In one recent deal, a buyer highlighted how a firm’s non-linear growth—achieving higher revenue without proportional headcount growth—was one of the decisive factors.

• Competitive Advantage: Proven client outcomes and measurable impact consistently rank high on buyers’ lists. Demonstrating a track record of delivering tangible results sets firms apart in competitive markets.

By focusing on these aspects, consultancy leaders can build firms that perform well today and have clear potential for sustainable growth.

## 3. Client Stability and Diversity

Clients are the lifeblood of any consultancy, and their profile significantly impacts a firm’s value. From my conversations with buyers, client-related metrics are often among the first areas they assess. The buyer’s lens emphasizes:

• Avoiding Client Concentration Risk: No single client should account for more than 20% of revenue. I’ve seen deals fall when this risk isn’t addressed, as buyers are wary of overdependency.

• Contracted, Reliable Revenue: Long-term client relationships with recurring revenue models ensure predictability and stability. Buyers I’ve worked with frequently mention how contracted revenue—retainers or multi-year agreements—provides confidence in the firm’s future earnings.

Consultancy owners should nurture a balanced client portfolio and build strong, ongoing relationships. Buyers consistently note that a diversified and loyal client base reduces risk and makes the firm more attractive.

## 4. Operational Independence: The Role of the Management Team

The ability of a consultancy to operate independently of its founders is a key factor in its long-term viability. In my work with buyers, this is often one of the first areas they evaluate. Buyers assess:

• Documented Processes and Methodologies: Clear, repeatable systems ensure consistency and scalability. I’ve observed buyers pay close attention to whether processes are institutionalized or reliant on key individuals.

• Accountability and Alignment: A management team with clearly defined roles and a unified growth agenda signals strong leadership. Buyers frequently highlight the importance of team cohesion and strategic clarity.

• Leadership Retention: Long-term commitment from key leaders demonstrates stability and reduces transition risks. I’ve seen buyers walk away from firms where leadership turnover raised concerns about continuity.

• Succession Planning: Clear plans for leadership succession ensure continuity. Buyers value firms with a visible path for the next generation of leaders, reducing reliance on current owners.

• Owner Independence: Firms not overly reliant on their founders are far more attractive to buyers. They represent sustainable, self-sufficient businesses. In my experience, buyers often emphasize this as a make-or-break factor in their decisions.

Building a robust management infrastructure is essential for consultancies aiming to thrive independently and attract interest from strategic buyers or investors.

*Recommended reading:Without Internal Alignment, a Boutique Consultancy Is Doomed*

## Conclusion: A Holistic View Through the Buyer’s Lens

The buyer’s lens has often given me a transformative perspective for evaluating consulting firms.

Focusing on reliable financials, growth potential, client stability, operational independence, and how buyers evaluate their 'targets' can help consulting firms better understand improving consultancy performance.

For consultancy leaders, adopting this lens isn’t about preparing for a potential acquisition; it’s about building a resilient, competitive firm for long-term success.

It shifts the focus from short-term financial metrics to a holistic view of what makes a consulting business truly valuable—for buyers, clients, and the firm’s future.

So, why not start using 'the buyer’s lens' today?

# The Biggest Mistakes Consulting Firms Made in 2024

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers & Florian Heinrichs
**Data:** 23 January 2025
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/biggest-mistakes-consulting-firms-made-in-2024

---

We have worked with dozens of consulting firms this past year. Each one, on the surface level, presented a unique case. They were in different industries, offering other services, and were of various sizes. Yet, as we delved deeper, recurring patterns and common themes among these consultancies became apparent.

These big mistakes often keep these consulting firms stuck in low-margin, project-by-project work, struggling to break through ‘The Project Wall’.

In this article, we’ll dive deeper into some of the most common or pronounced mistakes we’ve observed.

## 11 mistakes consulting firms make that hinder their growth

No, this list is not just about the challenging market. Yes, despite upticks in several expertise domains and industries, the consulting market remains challenging. Budgets are under pressure, competition is fierce, and clients are more cautious. None of this is particularly new. We’ve been operating under restrictive market conditions for several years.

The truth is that the mistakes we are discussing here aren't symptoms of a tough market. They amplify the market challenges.

Vague propositions, short-term thinking, and capability selling (without intentionally designed client success journeys) hurt performance and push consultancies into the sea of sameness, making them indistinguishable from the thousands of other firms.

### #1. The ad-hoc approach instead of intentional design

We’ve seen too many firms operate reactively. They improvise, chase immediate urgencies, and “go with the flow”.

These consultancies often sell a “raw” capability—taking on any project related to their area of expertise or capabilities. Unsurprisingly, this leads to unstable revenue, inconsistent quality, and a lot of variance in the firm. It only increases complexity costs and reduces the opportunity to build true expertise. Without even intending to, these consulting firms become jacks-of-all-trades instead of highly sought-after masters who get paid premium fees.

So, how can these firms turn it around? What are high-performing consultancies doing differently to protect their businesses from the downward spiral? They employ intentional design to determine the parameters of their work.

Intentional design involves developing and implementing strategies for attracting clients, delivering value, and ensuring long-term growth. Not every incoming client request is accepted—only those that fit neatly into the narrowly defined area of expertise and service portfolio. Instead of “going with the flow,” these consulting firms use an education-based inbound motion to attract prospects, a constantly evaluated and optimised process. Every action is a measured, predetermined step in a specific direction.

### #2. Vague, fluffy consultancy propositions

“We help you grow revenue and decrease costs”. We have encountered a variation of this type of proposition an alarming number of times. There is nothing concrete – just vague promises.

Another common approach to consultancy propositions we’ve noticed is capability-based – e.g., “We are experts in [insert category] consulting”. You don’t say!

These propositions lack specificity, clarity, and personality. Who are they catering to? What specific problems do they resolve for their clients? What is their unique method for resolving these problems? That’s what a risk-averse modern consulting service buyer wants to know.

On the other hand, high-performing consulting firms stand out with their value-driven propositions. They convey a distinct point of view, conviction, and culture. They don’t try to impress with their “90 years of combined experience.” Instead, they attract clients and command premium fees due to their demonstrated track record of achieving measurable results.

Still very common: Low scores in the “Proposition Review” TVA does for clients. Vertical: the Value Proposition Dimensions. Horizontal: the Specificy-Precision-Personality Dimensions. The average score of our projects is around 35/75.

• Specificity:Clarify which specific issue, ideal client, and method you focus on.

• Precision:The clarity and vividness with which you describe the above.

• Personality:Bring your point-of-view and core beliefs to the fore.

### #3. Struggling to attract new clients

We have come across many firms that rely on hope-based pipelines instead of intentional visibility and sharp, issue-led messaging. “Winging it” appears to be the foundation of their business development.

In our experience, such a lack of systematised client attraction is often caused by a lack of strategic investment and a disciplined approach to strengthening business development and marketing capabilities and strategies. We have spoken to numerous consulting owners and leaders who were unwilling to commit resources to building marketing capabilities or were uncertain about where to start.

Consulting is an industry riddled with marketing and sales misconceptions. Many people stubbornly follow old-school strategies, such as winning and dining prospects and cold outreaches.

Conversely, high-performing consulting firms have long adopted a systematised approach to inbound client attraction. Leadership and marketing teams collaborate to develop messaging, audience education-driven thought leadership, promotional strategies, lead capture funnels, and strict lead qualification standards.

### #4. Lack of a signature methodology

One of our biggest learnings in the past year is that clients want proven approaches and predictable outcomes. They want to minimise risk.

Unfortunately, we’ve seen many firms operate without a clearly articulated, ownable methodology. Their inability to explain their unique, time-tested approach to resolving clients’ pain points reduces their appeal. As far as prospects are concerned, too much risk is involved, which leads to either rejections or lower fees.

As a result, these consulting firms get stuck in the commodity zone, constantly having to prove their worth through lengthy, time-consuming, and fully customised project proposals.

*Recommended reading:The Best Consulting Pitch I’ve Ever Seen*

### #5. No programmatic existing client development

Sustainable growth is difficult—if not impossible—to achieve without financial stability as its foundation. Unfortunately, many consultancies we’ve worked with or spoken to struggled to achieve such financial stability due to their reliance on short-term, one-off projects for most of their revenue. They hit the “project wall.”

Financial stability in the consulting business comes from revenue and pipeline predictability, which is hard to achieve without developing long-term client relationships.

This is not to say that we didn’t observe consultancies having any existing clients. Many do. However, in most instances, such account expansion resulted from an individual consultant “owning” the relationship. While it is commendable that these consulting firms have team members who can build such a high level of trust with their accounts, it presents serious risks for the business. What happens when this person leaves? Chances are that, eventually, so will their account.

Programmatic existing client development involves systematically converting new clients into loyal, long-term partners by deepening relationships, building trust, and consistently delivering value – as a business and a brand. High-performing consulting firms excel at this. They typically attract prospects through their reputation as the “go-to” experts. They sign up these prospects by demonstrating specific outcomes that they can achieve. Upon building a solid foundation of trust, they retain these clients through a strategically designed service portfolio, continuing to offer tangible value to clients over an extended period.

### #6. Content without substance

Not every piece of content that consultancies and their team members create can be considered true thought leadership… and that’s fine. But a lot of it should be, and this often isn’t the case.

Most of the material out there seems to be generic, self-centered noise. We encounter such pieces daily—vague posts utterly detached from the firm’s expertise.

It's great to see more firms try to publish helpful content with some regularity. But this in itself isn't enough: the quality has to be there, too. Unfortunately, we see many firms turn to outsourcing "thought leadership" work to junior employees, external agencies, or worse: AI... it's a surefire way to guarantee your publicantion won't stand out.

If it sounds like every other consultancy, it won’t build authority.

To be impactful, content should be based on profound expertise. It is a critical job for the most senior experts in the firm and a key contribution to marketing, business development, and IP creation.

Would you trust a neuroscientist who had their graduation thesis and all subsequent publications written by students or AI?

### #7. Horrible websites

We-we-we storytelling filled with endless ‘table stakes’: great teams, client-centric, innovative approaches. You name it. We’ve seen plenty of it. The truth is that these are the bare minimum expectations that clients have. They are not differentiators.

Such poorly designed websites are typically a result of one of two systemic problems: poor value proposition or leadership’s misconception about modern marketing and sales practices. We’ve talked to many consultancies who still underestimate how helpful a functional website can be as a sales channel and a step in the sales process. This leads them to build horrible sites, failing to sell anything. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy to the detriment of these firms.

In the age where modern buyers do online research before even considering reaching out to an external partner, winning business via the web is possible. However, the digital footprint must be there and carefully curated and designed to appeal to the target audience. A website is one of the key elements of the digital presence.

### #8. Relying on hiring new salespeople as the silver bullet

There is nothing inherently wrong with having a dedicated business development or sales specialist. We’ve talked to a number of such people, and they are truly the rainmakers in their firms. However, these people are so successful in their jobs because these consulting firms have proper systems in place to support and facilitate the work of these sales professionals.

Unfortunately, such examples were relatively rare. A more common practice that we’ve seen among consulting firms is hiring a sales executive and then leaving them high and dry.

These BD leaders are expected to attract new clients, develop existing accounts, and magically transform the business, yet are often set up to fail from day one.

These consultancies have no differentiating value proposition. They have a poor expertise reputation. They utilise junior or generic marketing support. Often, internal alignment is superficial at best.

BD leaders often lack the necessary resources. They are disconnected from the client experience and focus solely on new client acquisition. Even the most talented sales professionals would struggle to succeed under such conditions.

We urge consultancies to remember: “Typical successful” firms will need 3-4x their new revenue target to meet their growth objectives; “high-performing” firms still need ~2x. We encourage consultancies to ask themselves whether a single BD director can achieve that, given the entire firm did a mere 2.5 in the past year. Doubtful…

*Recommended reading:Hiring a Business Development Leader Will Not Fix Boutique Consultancies’ Growth Problems*

### #9. Service portfolio creep

Another common mistake we’ve seen several consultancies make because of their reactive mode of operation is expanding services solely to capture a larger audience or accommodate incoming requests.

This not only leads to diluted positioning and operational complexity but also erodes credibility. When a consultancy of 30 people offers 12 service lines, it is hard to sell prospects on its ability to deliver. Simple math dictates that the consultancy should have no more than 2.5 experts per service line.

We acknowledge that service portfolios can change over time. We often encourage consultancies to return to the drawing board and redesign their offering. However, it should be a deliberate exercise that is centred around the goal of refining and deepening core expertise.

### #10. No clear client impact data

Every consulting firm that we’ve spoken to claims to deliver value. Of course, they do. That’s what the consulting industry is built around – the ability of outside experts to achieve results that clients can’t achieve internally.

Sadly, most failed to document, measure, and showcase specific client results to prove their claim.

In many cases, this was due to their ad-hoc modus operandi. The high variance of engagement types and client issues makes standardising data aggregation tough. And this begs the question: How will these consulting firms ever reach a point where they can speak credibly to the results their methods deliver if every new project is new?

### #11. Underinvesting in talent attraction

A common theme in our conversations with consulting firms was their struggle to recruit top consulting talent. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the most likely reasons were their weak employer value propositions (EVPs), unclear career paths, or lack of signature projects that inspire talent to join.

This is another unfortunate consequence of an ad-hoc business management and growth approach. If senior leaders within a consultancy do not have clarity about the journey their business is on, how can they create professional journeys for their talent? In fact, how can they even know with any degree of certainty what type of talent they should invest in?

## In conclusion

Mistakes repeat when lessons aren’t learned.

If any of the mistakes we’ve listed here hit too close to home, 2025 is the year to stop playing small and rethink the fundamentals.

We encourage consulting firms to think of these mistakes as improvement and growth opportunities. Oftentimes, addressing one of these problem areas sparks a chain reaction. Designing a value proposition, for example, forces consultancy leaders to rethink their service portfolio, leading to a redesign of the digital presence.

# Defining The High-Performing Consulting Firm

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 15 January 2025

---

This article was last updated on 28 February 2025.

“If you knew a way to become a high-performing consultancy, would you adopt it?” This is the first thing prospects see when they come across our website.For years, I’ve been obsessed with uncovering and documenting what makes consulting firms truly high-performing.However, what is a high-performing consulting firm based on my observations from the trenches?I decided to address this question after a call with a prospect a few weeks ago – a founder and managing partner of a consultancy. “Luk, I know you focus on helping consultancies become high-performing, but I think we’re already there. We just need an outside perspective on a new service we plan to launch.”Sure, no problem. I can do that. I’ve acted as an independent outside party to provide an objective opinion on requests like this dozens of times. It's a piece of cake, I thought.Boy, was I wrong!The next step was to set up a discovery process where I would first gain a deeper understanding of what the consultancy does, how it does it, what problems it solves, who it caters to, and what the unique selling points are. This foundational information was crucial for me to be able to advise on the new service launch.Unfortunately, once I started digging, I discovered that ‘high-performing’ was used interchangeably with ‘overworked’, ‘overextended’, and ‘aggressively yet unsustainably growing’.None of the criteria that I typically use to determine a consultancy's level of performance were met to qualify it for the ‘high-performing’ status.That’s why, in this post, I’d like to clarify what I mean by high-performing consulting firms and what, in my opinion, doesn’t cut it.

## What is a high-performing consultancy?

While I've noticed about a dozen characteristics high-performing consultancies share, I can narrow them down to four large categories. Now, this is not based on scientific research or data analysis. Instead, it’s based on my observations working in the trenches of consulting for many years.

• Clients seek them out - attract instead of chase

• Long-term client relationships - programmatic client development

• High gross margins - the flow-through effect

• Attracting and retaining top consulting talent

Let’s go over these one by one.

### #1. Clients seek them out - attract instead of chase

The first indicator that signals that a consultancy is a high-performing one is how it acquires its clients. Such consultancies don’t waste time chasing clients. The majority of new business revenue comes from inbound inquiries. Their reputation and reach – built on a clear, compelling, and outcome-driven value proposition – draw the right clients to them. They are considered as ‘The Reference’, the go-to consultancy in a particular expertise domain.

This allows the consultancy to achieve the following:

• Charge premium fees: Clients are typically happy to pay the fees because of the tangible, accurately predicted value that the consultancy can deliver

• Fuel growth: These consulting firms typically rely on existing clients to generate most of their revenue and keep new client acquisitions to fuel growth. They have a healthy pipeline of work and leave around 30% of revenue to be filled with projects for new clients.

• Work with “ideal” clients: When client acquisition is inbound, consultancies can afford to be picky about who they work with, allowing them to fill their pipeline with their “ideal” clients.

• Have higher win rates: The ability to turn client acquisition into a primarily inbound activity means the consultancy offers high-value results, which makes outbound client acquisition that much stronger.

• Lower client acquisition costs (CAC): Three out of four inbound marketing mediums cost less than any other outbound marketing tactic. Additionally, inbound marketing costs tend to decrease over time as consultancies build up a catalogue of knowledge that they revisit, update, and build upon.

• Turn clients into long-term contracts: High-performing consultancies strive to develop meaningful, value-based relationships with their clients through strategic key account management.

### #2. Long-term client relationships - programmatic client development

High-performing consultancies never hit 'The Project Wall' – completing one-off, smaller projects requires constantly competing for new clients. Instead, they retain and develop existing clients over an extended period usingprogrammatic client success journey design – intentional, repeatable playbooks for client success journeys that enable them to deepen relationships and ensure long-term impact.

Here are a few examples of client success journeys I’ve worked on in the past.

• Strategic client roadmap:Developed in the early stages of the new client project, often the output of an initial discovery service (e.g., a feasibility study). It's a ‘client success architecture’ in a way. It encompasses all project details, including the long-term journey to client/project success.

• Key milestone design: Instead of focusing on all the project details (from the previous Client Roadmap), high-performing consulting firms concentrate on co-identifying (co-creation with the client) pivotal client success moments to track client development and activate interventions at crucial points in the engagement.

• Change adoption journey: This structured framework focuses on helping clients embed and sustain the outcomes of the initial consultancy project. This client success journey also involves assessing change readiness (pre-project), mapping out key adoption milestones, developing regular metrics and feedback loops to measure adoption progress, and designing specific interventions to reinforce new behaviours or systems.

• Hybrid journey:Some combination of all the previously mentioned journeys.

The outcomes of such dedication to programmatic client development and retention are typically the following:

• Revenue stability: About 70% of the revenue comes from existing clients, creating a stable revenue foundation. There is no ‘hustle mode’ to chase new clients, and there is no constant stress over cash flow.

• Balanced corporate culture: Revenue stability and pipeline predictability mean that employees – consulting teams and their leaders – work in a healthy culture where they are not underutilised or overextended at any point. It’s a balanced pace where every team member knows the expectations and what tomorrow will bring.

• Expertise depth: Continuity in client work also allows high-performing consultancies to discover typical client journeys over a more extended period, continuously deepening their expertise, which only increases the value of their work over time.

*Recommended reading:The Best Consulting Pitch I’ve Ever Seen*

### #3. High gross margins - the flow-through effect

I’ve seen such stark differences between high-performing and average consultancies that I sometimes couldn’t believe they cater to the same audience!

The industry average for gross margins seems to be around 20-30%. High-performing consulting firms, on the other hand, are able to achieve exceptional profitability, with gross margins often exceeding 50%. I’ve worked with consultancies with >60-70% gross margins consistently!

These consultancies can achieve such outstanding results because:

• Developing existing clients is far more profitable;

• They sell their services at premium pricing because of their differentiating expertise and signature methodology (and don't get challenged);

• They foster a narrow focus and specialisation, leading to a high degree of repetition of similar projects, standardisation of methodology/process, and low variability of outcomes—all of which lead to high efficiency and productivity, optimised operational costs, and more accessible training of new consultants.

High-performing consultancies don’t just work hard; they work smart, focusing on high-value engagements that reflect their expertise.

### #4. Attracting and retaining top consulting talent

Consulting is a people business. People are the main asset and a crucial contributor to success. Because of their strong client value propositions, use cases, and outcome-driven testimonials, high-performing consulting firms don’t just attract clients, they also attract the best talent in the market. Senior consultants and specialists are drawn to firms with a clear vision, proven methodologies, and a reputation for excellence.

Consultancies compete in two markets: the client market and the employee market. These two are directly linked. I’ve observed on numerous occasions that when a consultancy struggles in one market, the other one suffers. The inability to recruit top talent will impact the quality of client results. Similarly, the failure to recruit the “ideal” clients and the inability to build a predictable pipeline of work and revenue results in high turnovers, poor reputation among job seekers, and poor recruitment results.

## What a high-performing consultancy is NOT

Now that I have covered the foundational elements that make a consultancy high-performing, I’d like to address some common misconceptions about the concept.

• Revenue growth is not a reliable indicator of high performance. While revenue growth can indeed be observed in high-performing consulting firms, this indicator on its own means nothing. Growing at an unsustainable rate, doing so by overextending employees, increasing costs at the same or higher rate as revenue growth, and growing revenue at the expense of profits are all indicators of a consultancy that is going to implode. It’s just a matter of time.

• High variability of services is usually an indicator of a low-performing consultancy. When I see a smaller consultancy offering a buffet of services to multiple audiences, I already know that their profit margins are low (potentially non-existent), and the consultancy is overextended. It’s unable to deliver value past superficial levels, which means it’s not getting paid premium fees, which, in turn, means it always has to hustle to recruit new clients.

• The ability to recruit new clients to cover more than 40% of revenue is not high-performing behaviour. I’ve talked to consultancy owners who were proud of the fact that they had no problem acquiring new clients. However, they were not able or willing to develop that relationship into long-term client engagements. Instead, most of the revenue was dependent on client recruitment. Unfortunately, that indicates service design flaws and a lack of business maturity.

• Predominantly outbound client acquisition is not an indicator of a high-performing consultancy, no matter how successful. I don’t care how good consultants and consulting leaders/owners are at soliciting business if they do so through outbound methods. This method is simply too costly. The time of consultants with deep expertise is too valuable to be spent on sending prospecting emails, doing cold calls, and putting together sales pitches and customised proposals.

## In conclusion

Achieving the status of a high-performing consultancy is about more than just impressive revenue growth or a broad range of services. It involves a strategic focus on inbound client acquisition, retaining and developing existing clients, and maintaining high gross margins. None of this happens overnight and requires intentional design.High-performing consulting firms create a sustainable and profitable business model by specialising and honing their expertise. They build strong, long-term client relationships, ensure stable revenue streams, and foster a healthy work environment where employees can thrive without being overextended.This allows consultancies to deliver exceptional value consistently, justifying premium fees and fueling continued growth.Such firms don’t struggle recruiting consultants – top talent wants to work for these businesses.Consultancies that are still chasing clients, struggling to retain them, and operating on thin margins still have a way to go.It's time to rethink their strategy, redefine their value proposition, and stop playing small with one-off projects at low/average pricing and no chance to develop a repeatable methodology, and instead invest in the expertise, reputation, and visibility.

# 133 Pieces of Advice I Shared on LinkedIn in 2024

2024 was a transformative year for many consulting businesses.

I've observed many boutique consultancies trying to address the challenge of modern service buyers being more cautious than ever in their choice of external partner.

While the consultancy market and the demand for consulting services have risen again, buyers increasingly seek partners with exceptional expertise. They also want to minimise risk, another critical factor in their decision-making process.

Furthermore, buyers are less loyal than ever. Due to the abundance of options and their changing needs and buying journey, C-level executives are less hesitant to replace existing partners with those who can offer more value, better pricing, or faster results.

In light of all these market dynamics, I witnessed boutique consultancies adopt a wide range of strategies:

• Some added new services to their portfolio to appeal to a larger market segment.

• Some focused on cost-cutting measures, creating leaner teams and reducing operational costs.

• Several boutique consultancy businesses got more proactive in their thought leadership efforts in a solid attempt to grow their reputational footprint.

• A few returned to the drawing board to reassess their business models, sharpen their expertise, create a stronger value proposition, and re-introduce themselves to the market as go-to experts in a more narrow expertise domain. (I loved seeing those!)

As I watched these strategies play out – sometimes from the sidelines and often as an external advisor to these boutique consultancies – I continued to write down everything I was learning along the way: the common mistakes I witnessed, roadmaps to success, and everything in between.

As a result, in 2024, much of the advice I shared – both on LinkedIn and through my blog articles – was around the following themes:

# Without Internal Alignment, a Boutique Consultancy Is Doomed

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 12 December 2024

---

This article was last updated on 12 December 2024.

A few months ago, a consultancy of around 40 consultants hired me to review its overall performance and assess the clarity of its consultancy proposition.Here are some basic facts about the consultancy that I can disclose:

• Established in 2018

• It has 3 founders and 4 director-level senior consultants

• Offers services in the expertise domain of data and analytics

• Caters to large consumer-facing businesses in a variety of industries

I had a separate call with each founder and three out of four directors. “Who is your ideal client?” I asked. I received six completely different answers, ranging from “a multinational company in retail” to “any large company that needs help centralising and optimising their first-party data efforts while being compliant with data privacy regulations.”The foundational problem that resulted in significant business development challenges became abundantly clear: a severe lack of alignment among founders and leaders.In this article, I’d like to discuss the profound impact of internal misalignment on the growth prospects of a boutique consultancy.

## What causes the misalignment within boutique consultancies

Getting boutique consultancy partners aligned on their strategic agenda, especially regarding expertise focus (how narrow) and value proposition specificity, is by far the most challenging aspect of my consultancy performance improvement work.I sometimes think that getting boutique consultancy partners to agree on their firm's identity and focus is like trying to herd cats—everyone goes in their own direction.The lack of alignment stems from a mix of personal and professional reasons, making it even more challenging to get everyone on the same page.So what are those reasons? From my observations, they fall into four main categories:

• Ego: A healthy amount of ambition, drive, and confidence are a good thing in a consulting business. I would even go as far as to say they are very much needed. However, there is a fine line between confidence and ego. When unchecked, the latter is a toxic trait that clouds decision-making and infects internal morale.

• FOMO: The Fear of Missing Out is a common issue among partners in boutique consultancies. When financial performance dips, every project looks like a lifeline, even when it's not an ideal fit. This fear of losing revenue can push consultancy owners to accept misaligned projects and clients to keep afloat. I get it—I’ve been there myself in my early consulting days. But if this pattern continues, the business risks straying from its core expertise, diluting its brand, and burning out the team, all for short-term survival.

• Siloed thinking: Occurs when different teams – with their leaders at the helm – operate independently without effective communication or collaboration, leading to fragmented perspectives and goals. This isolation often creates misunderstandings about project objectives, client needs, and strategic priorities, resulting in disjointed efforts that lack cohesion in each team pursuing its agenda.

• Existential stress: When a business struggles, I’ve witnessed many consultancy owners and leaders snap into a crisis management mode. Unfortunately, this often means different things to the leaders. Some think the way to recovery lies in cutting costs. Others start offering additional services to their clients or discounts to prospects. Yet others exponentially increase their sales efforts and begin reaching out to prospects outside the target audience.

*Recommended reading:How a Consultancy Can Get Crushed by the Ego of Its Owners*

### The lack of alignment on what constitutes "Best Engagements"

The first step in my work with boutique consultancy clients is to review their past 10–15 “Best Engagements.”These are the projects they consider their absolute benchmarks—the ones they’d love to replicate over and over.Florian Heinrichs and I dig into key details: project size, buyer profile, business issue solved, trigger point (why now?), type of engagement, service delivered, total cost, gross margin, impact, and—here’s the kicker—why they consider it a “best engagement.”And this is where it almost always gets (very) challenging.When we bring this question into partner discussions, it’s rarely straightforward:

• One partner highlights the financials: “This project was highly profitable.”

• Another talks about the client profile: “It was with a perfect-fit client we’d love to attract more of.”

• Someone else emphasizes collaboration quality: “It was a joy to work with that team.”

• Another points to client retention: “This engagement led to a long-term partnership with recurring opportunities.”

Discussions turn into debates, often into disagreements. The criteria for what makes a “best engagement” vary wildly within the same leadership team. Almost always.

This lack of alignment often stems from one key issue: it hasn’t been clearly defined.

The ownership team hasn’t collectively decided what success exactly looks like—beyond a vague sense of good outcomes. This creates space for subjective interpretations, often pulling the team in conflicting directions.

## The negative impacts of the lack of leadership alignment in boutique consultancies

When partners can't agree on their firm's profile, focus, or expertise, it creates a lack of clarity that ripples through everything—from value proposition design, business development, client acquisition, and project efficiency to financial stability.

Until there is a unified vision and a high degree of discipline to adhere to in almost every situation, a consultancy risks standing for nothing and achieving even less.I’ve observed different degrees of (mis)alignment throughout my years of work with boutique consultancies. Here are some of the most damaging consequences these firms faced as a result:

• Unclear positioning in the market: When a value proposition changes from one senior leader to another, the voice of the consultancy gets lost in the highly saturated consultancy market. Instead of beingthe go-toconsultancy for a specific problem in a specific niche, it becomesone of the many unimpressiveconsultancies that try to grab every opportunity possible, irrespective of the ability to deliver equally well on all of them. That’s a massive red flag to prospects – that is if prospects ever even come across that consultancy.

• Inconsistent—and often conflicting—external and internal messaging: Conflicting priorities among consultancy leaders can lead to mixed signals for employees and clients, causing confusion about the consultancy's goals and direction.

• Inefficient resource allocation: Without a unified vision of what projects to take on and how to execute the work, resources often get misallocated to projects that don’t deliver the same financial value/long-term growth potential.

• Poor team morale and lack of collaboration: When a consultancy owner says one thing but the team leader gives a different set of instructions and priorities, employees feel frustrated and disengaged. Collaboration grinds to a halt, diminishing motivation and productivity and leading to high turnover rates.

• Dissatisfied clients: A lack of alignment can result in inconsistent service delivery, eroding client trust and satisfaction, ultimately affecting retention and referrals.

• Low marketing and business development ROI: Inconsistent messaging and priorities from leadership turn marketing and business development efforts into chaos. This confuses prospects and undermines the consultancy’s brand identity in the marketplace.

• Slower decision-making: Siloed leadership agendas can lead to protracted discussions and delays in decision-making, slowing down project timelines and responsiveness to market changes.

### Internal alignment “acid tests”

In my client work, I don’t recall a single time where senior leadership told me right out of the gate that they lacked alignment. How is that possible? Don’t they know?

Too often, these firms did not even realise how deep the problem went. The lack of alignment does not necessarily bubble up onto the surface in the form of conflict, loud disagreements, and confrontations. Most of the time, it’s not antagonistic at all.Usually, it’s a few partners (owners, senior leaders, etc.) doing their own thing based on the priorities they believe would benefit the overall business and their teams and then not talking to each other. They dismiss the notion that differences in priorities can negatively impact the business.Most of the time, I must poke and probe to determine whether it is a strategic division of roles or a lack of alignment.Here are some ‘acid tests’ I've used to poke and probe:

• Homepage alignment: Do they put it on the homepage after agreeing on the firm’s focus and expertise? A hesitation to immediately publish? Alignment alert!

• Prospect conversations: Do the partners say no when a prospect asks for work outside the agreed core expertise and value proposition? A hesitation? Alignment alert!

• External messaging: Can every partner communicate the firm’s value proposition and focus in the same clear terms (e.g., at a conference or in a hiring interview)? Scattered stories? Alignment alert!

## Resolving the problem of misalignment: the starting point

So, how can consultancies address the misalignment problem once they identify it as an issue?There are several ways to do it. My approach is always the same: I go back to the drawing board and (re) design the value proposition.

A consultancy’s value proposition is the foundation upon which everything else is built. And I do mean everything:

• What types of projects get accepted from which specific audiences, with what sort of problems, and what kind of improvements are needed

• How the consultancy pitches and explains its expertise, business case, and possible outcomes that can be achieved

• What business development activities get priority, and how are they executed by who

• How a signature methodology gets developed and standardised (SOPs) over time to create competitive differentiation

• How key clients/accounts get retained and programmatically developed over the long haul

• What investments are made into technology infrastructure (e.g., PSA) and in attracting, hiring, training, rewarding and retaining top talent

• How the pipeline gets managed and translated into financial forecasts and resource planning

• How the expertise gets shared in the market to educate and inspire the target audience+ About a hundred other small and large decisions that consultancy owners and leaders need to consider regularly

Value proposition design is not easy, and it certainly cannot be accomplished in a single day. However, it can clarify where every leadership member stands on all the essential issues. As a result, it will reveal friction points, allowing leaders to identify the source of different perspectives and goals and develop a solution during such a foundational review.

The good news is that a strong value proposition a leadership team is aligned around can have a hugely transformational impact on internal alignment in the short and long term. So, I invite consultancy owners and leaders to embark upon this journey.

*Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design*

## Internal alignment: a new KPI to monitor

I often recommend scheduling a quarterly internal alignment survey (with everybody participating—from owners/partners to the team) to keep everyone on the same page and prevent misalignment from creeping in.

As I wrote in my article, alignment issues usually manifest when partners and leaders have differing views on the business's direction or how to prioritize initiatives.

A short, focused quarterly internal survey can help reveal these discrepancies early and address them before they become more significant problems. A consultancy can consider it a new KPI to monitor, and the partner or leadership team discusses the score quarterly and takes corrective action.

Here are the three essential questions I suggest for the quarterly survey:

1. Do we have a clear and shared understanding of our consultancy’s vision and strategic goals?

2. Are our current clients and projects aligned with our defined value proposition and expertise focus?

3. Are we consistently disciplined in communicating with clients and prospects in a way that aligns with our internally agreed positioning?

## In conclusion

Without internal alignment, a boutique consultancy is not just hindered – it’s set on a path to mediocrity or even failure.Misalignment among leadership stifles the firm’s ability to communicate a clear value proposition, make effective decisions, and maintain strong client relationships. It leads to wasted resources, poor team morale, and a diluted expertise reputation.I strongly urge boutique consultancies to stop living in denial and stop pretending that internal alignment is just about dividing and conquering tasks. Addressing the problem of internal alignment isn't just a business priority. It's essential for financial stability and future success.A carriage that gets pulled in different directions doesn’t get far. It can’t compete against one being pulled by 4 horses moving in the same direction.

# Why Boutique Consultancies Should Rethink Utilisation

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 26 November 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-boutique-consultancies-should-rethink-utilisation

---

"At the big firms, you get moved around like a chess piece on a board." This quote from a Financial Times article stuck with me as I reflected on some of the larger boutique consultancies I’ve worked with.

For many, utilisation is treated as the ultimate metric—the defining measure of efficiency, health, and performance. But here’s the thing: utilisation may matter, but it’s not the end game. An obsessive focus on utilisation can do more harm than good for boutique consultancies.

In this article, I’ll explain why.

## Utilisation: A Useful Metric, But Not the Metric

Let me start with a story.

I once worked with a mid-sized, owner-led tech consultancy—50 consultants on the payroll and two hands-on partners. During our first strategy session, the conversation quickly turned to utilisation and billable hours.It was a red flag.

Why? Their service offering was all over the place. They were chasing revenue with a patchwork pipeline of random projects, taking on whatever work came their way just to keep people busy.

The pressure to maintain utilisation led them to focus on inputs—hours billed—rather than outcomes, like value delivered.

• Stress: Consultants were stretched too thin, juggling mismatched projects.

• Mediocre work: Rushed timelines and overworked teams led to declining quality.

• No thought leadership: They had no bandwidth to innovate or develop intellectual capital.

• Damaged reputation: Clients weren’t referring to them because their value proposition lacked clarity.

• Neglected client development: The team was overburdened by chasing utilisation, so no time was left to deepen relationships or identify new opportunities with existing clients.

Here’s the problem with utilisation: it’s a measure of how busy you are, not how successful you are. When your pipeline of potential projects outweighs your consultancy firm's current capacity to execute—a common scenario for fast-growing boutique consultancies—chasing utilisation is like trying to empty a flooded basement with a teaspoon.

### In my four post-acquisition years at Deloitte, I never managed utilisation.

Utilisation became irrelevant because we were blessed with more opportunities than resources. The real question wasn’t “Are we busy?” but “Are we using our limited capacity to accept the right opportunities?”

When utilisation is a consultancy’ North Star:

• They risk taking on low-value projects just to keep the team billing.

• High-value opportunities that require expertise investment get sidelined.

• The team risks burnout, and the reputation as a premium consultancy suffers.

The opportunity isn’t in doingmore. It’s in doing therightwork—work that builds the consultancy’s reputation, deepens client trust, and commands premium fees.

*Recommended reading:How a Boutique Consultancy Can Escape the Toxic Chasing of New Clients*

## First Comes the Value Proposition, Then Service Design, Then Utilisation

Utilisation is a helpful tool for understanding resource allocation and efficiency, but its value depends on a solid foundation. For boutique consultancies, this starts with a clear value proposition—defining the unique problems solved, outcomes delivered, and differentiation from competitors.

A well-defined value proposition guides service design, which structures offerings and delivery processes to meet client needs. However, service design alone is not enough. For utilisation to be meaningful, services must first be validated—proven through repetition to deliver value reliably—and matured, with processes refined over time to maximise efficiency and impact.

Only when services are validated and matured can utilisation become a refinement tool. At this stage, it helps to:

• Identify bottlenecks in delivery processes.

• Reallocate resources to improve efficiency.

• Optimise the balance between capacity and project opportunities.

Without these foundations, utilisation risks driving inefficiency and misalignment. But when grounded in a sharp value proposition and robust service design, it provides insights to fine-tune operations and enhance performance.

## The Consequences of Misplaced Focus

Focusing on utilisation without a robust service design leads to a series of negative outcomes:

• Burnout and turnover: Overworked consultants won’t stick around.

• Damaged client relationships: Rushed, low-quality work erodes trust.

• Stagnation: No time for thought leadership or innovation.

• Profit erosion: Low-value projects drain resources without building long-term value.

Contrast this with a consultancy built on intentional service design. Instead of chasing hours, they’re pursuing impactful, profitable work. Their team is energised, their clients are loyal, and their reputation grows stronger with every project.

## Conclusion: Build on Value, Not Busyness

Utilisation may be the sacred cow of consulting metrics, but it’s time to question its worth. A relentless focus on keeping the team busy risks creating a hamster wheel of burnout, inefficiency, and diluted impact.

The starting point for a resilient, high-performing consultancy lies in a sharp, well-definedvalue proposition. This clarity ensures the consultancy solves meaningful problems, delivers measurable outcomes, and stands out in the market.

With this foundation in place,service designthen structures how these services are delivered, ensuring consistency, scalability, and alignment with client needs.

When services are validated through repetition and matured over time,utilisation canevolve into a refinement tool—helping to identify bottlenecks, optimise efficiency, and strategically allocate capacity to high-value work.

Here’s what I learned in the consulting trenches in the past decade: Success in boutique consulting isn’t measured by how busy the team is but by the value created with every hour. A strong value proposition, supported by intentional service design, transforms utilisation from a survival metric into a lever forrefinement and operational excellence.

A consultancy measured by busyness isn’t built to last.

# The One Boutique Consultancy Metric That Tells It All

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 23 November 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-one-boutique-consultancy-metric-that-tells-it-all

---

Many KPIs can uncover insights into various aspects of a boutique consultancy business, such as proposal win rates, gross margins, revenue growth, cost of acquisition, client retention rate, client lifetime value, etc.I’m a big proponent of collecting and analysing performance data. It is imperative to clearly understand what a business is doing right and identify weak points.However, in this article, I want to focus on the most critical metric I believe every boutique consultancy owner should track diligently – the revenue per full-time employee (Rev/FTE) ratio.In my experience, this ratio tells it all. It is one of the most powerful metrics because of its long-term strategic implications. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most underutilised metrics in boutique consultancies.

## What the Rev/FTE ratio is

The Rev/FTE ratio measures how much revenue each consultant generates for the firm.This KPI is paramount in the consulting industry because, here, the primary asset is human capital, and the services provided by consultants essentially generate revenue.Analysing the Rev/FTE metric sheds light on how effectively the consultancy is leveraging its human capital to generate revenue. A positive trend in this ratio indicates growing efficiency, while a negative trend might signal operational challenges, service design mistakes, or specialisation misalignments.It can be a highly useful data point when optimising resource allocation, streamlining operations, improving service design, and ultimately enhancing the profitability of boutique consultancies.

### The 24-36-month Rev/FTE trailing metric

The power of the Rev/FTE ratio is hidden in the trend analysis. While boutique consultancy owners can derive valuable insights from stand-alone Rev/FTE measurements for each month, when analysing business growth and opportunities, consultancy owners and leaders should pay close attention to the Rev/FTE trend over a 24-36 month trailing period.Why analyse based on a 24-36-month trailing basis? Improving the metric is not easy. It takes time to move the needle. New automation and standardisation processes, for example, that a boutique consultancy implements take time to be adopted and properly utilised by all team members, not to mention that these processes may require a few rounds of optimisation.Depending on the specific changes a consultancy implements, shorter analysis periods can be considered. However, a 36-month trailing basis is typically the most effective timeframe to observe meaningful Revenue/FTE ratio shifts.

Rev/FTE changes don't happen overnight, so a long enough horizon is crucial to capture the impact of substantial changes in areas like service design and positioning.

## What Rev/FTE can uncover about a boutique consultancy business

We live in an era of labour shortages. As such, consultancies can no longer rely on finding top-notch experts as easily as they did 10 years ago.To remain strong, they must urgently pursue non-linear growth. That means decoupling revenue growth from the constant need to hire new (expensive) experts.This is where the Revenue/FTE monitoring steps in, playing a crucial role in strategic growth monitoring. It helps monitor non-linear growth by focusing on four core strategic actions.

While I've observed astonishing Revenue per FTE disparities in nearly identical consultancy profiles, ranging from as low as €75k to as high as €450k, it’s essential to avoid benchmarking or comparing directly with others. Instead, focus on setting an internal Revenue per FTE target that aligns with the consultancy's unique goals and context.

Start by establishing a baseline and then aim to improve, continuously moving the needle towards greater efficiency and profitability.

### #1. The effectiveness of service design

Say a boutique consultancy launched a new service offering.Initially, if the Rev/FTE decreases, it is not necessarily a point of concern. A new service takes time to mature (a couple of years, really). However, the Rev/FTE long-term analysis (36-48 months trailing) should show a positive trend to indicate that the new service offering is indeed maturing.

When it comes to service design, monitoring Rev/FTE will show the level of maturity and efficiency of the business: productisation, standardisation, technology integration, vertical service integration, or the need to create signature methodologies and SOPs to boost productivity.

The recommended reading below ('Why Vertical Service Integration...') explains that the consultancy I am writing about has improved the Rev/FTE ratio by more than 30% over two years due to its vertical service integration approach.Recommended reading:Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies

### #2. The team’s collective sales and business development capacity

The Rev/FTE ratio will also show the collective power of the consultants as sales and business development agents.I often observe that boutique consultancy owners are business development's primary—if not sole—drivers. While this is expected in the initial stages of the consultancy’s maturity, it’s crucial for the business development efforts to evolve as the consultancy matures.

At this point, sales and business development should become a collective responsibility shared by every consultant on the team, decentralising the effort and leveraging the firm's collective expertise.

The most high-performing boutique consultancies I’ve enjoyed working with are collective business development machines. And they don’t even engage in traditional ‘client chasing’.Instead, they have created a culture where individual consultants are encouraged – and expected – to share their expertise consistently. The consultants at such firms are educators. They are aligned around the consultancy’s crystal clear value proposition and regularly create content that addresses the target audience's pain points.These consultants are visible, trusted, and have a voice. They strengthen the consultancy’s reputation and generate demand for its services as a collective.So, if a boutique consultancy implements changes around its business development and sales strategy, tracking Rev/FTE will show how impactful those changes are (or not).

### #3. Long-term client/account development and expansion

Revenue stability is essential for consultancies aiming for sustainable, long-term growth. I advocate for earning 70% of revenue from existing clients to fuel stability and peace of mind.

The 'remaining' 30% of the revenue should come from acquiring new clients, which is crucial for fueling business growth, enhancing expertise, and maintaining healthy service pricing.

Both aspects are vital: existing clients provide the foundation for stability, while new clients drive expansion and innovation.

I’ve noticed that boutique consultancies that rely primarily on new client acquisition for revenue generation tend to have significantly lower Rev/FTE. This is not a shocking discovery. When new clients are the primary source of income, efficiency tends to take a nosedive. Chasing new clients also typically unstables overall revenue from month to month.Expanding the percentage of revenue that’s derived from existing clients through strategic account management and service design tends to lead to (1) higher revenue overall and (2) higher Rev/FTE due to higher efficiencies.Recommended reading:How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting Growth

### #4. Delivery productivity and effective scope management

Efficiency is critical to the success of a consulting business. As mentioned earlier, consulting is a service industry driven by the expertise and performance of consultants, who are the primary—and expensive—assets. Therefore, a boutique consultancy must strive to maximise the productivity and output of its consultants.Of course, some businesses interpret this as overworking and putting enormous pressure on employees. And that’s not good for anyone, not for the employees or for the consultancy, which risks experiencing higher turnover rates.Instead, I advocate arming the consultants with the tools and processes (SOPs) to make them efficient. Automation and process standardisation can eliminate many repetitive, tedious tasks. This gives the consultants time to focus on expertise-based client work, share educational content, deepen knowledge, and develop the client account.It also helps understand resource allocation and scope management. If Rev/FTE decreases as the consultancy grows, it may suggest that the firm is having difficulties effectively managing its expansion.Rev/FTE is the first metric that I urge boutique consultancy owners and leaders to monitor when they implement productivity-related changes or undergo an expansion.

In a 36-month trailing period, they should expect to see positive improvements. If these improvements do not materialise, it indicates that the implemented changes are not effective.

## Why Rev/FTE is essential for boutique consultancies

While Rev/FTE is a valuable indicator for all consultancies, irrespective of their size, I argue that it’s even more critical for boutique consultancies.Why? Because they don’t have the same resources as the Big 4s of the world. Multinational firms have the advantage of scale. They have an army of consultants and an extensive portfolio of technologies, processes, and methodologies that consultants can tap into.Boutique consultancies usually can’t compete on capacity. However, they can compete on expertise and the transformational outcomes they can deliver for a niche audience with specific problems.That’s why careful resource planning, process optimisation, automation, productisation, developing a signature methodology, revenue stability, and reducing the cost of client acquisition are paramount for boutique consultancies.The Rev/FTE ratio will provide insights into these areas, and boutique consultancy owners should be paying close attention.Recommended reading:The Two Most Visible Indicators of a High-Performing Boutique Consultancy

## In conclusion

In the era of labour shortages, the Rev/FTE ratio is paramount in the consulting industry. Human capital is the primary asset, and the services provided by consultants primarily generate revenue.

The Rev/FTE ratio comprehensively assesses organisational efficiency and productivity. Above all, achieving non-linear growth—decoupling revenue growth from hiring—is crucial. The Rev/FTE ratio is an excellent metric to help boutique consultancies measure their progress toward this goal.

This metric reveals critical information about service design efficiency, team sales capabilities, client development, and delivery productivity. It is especially significant for boutique consultancies, which must maximise their limited resources to compete against larger firms.Ultimately, the Rev/FTE ratio is not just a measure of revenue generation but a strategic tool that can guide boutique consultancies towards greater efficiency, stability, and sustainable growth.

# Do You Need New Consulting Services to Grow Revenue?

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 07 November 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/do-you-need-new-consulting-services-to-grow-revenue

---

This article was last updated on 7 November 2024.

There are various strategies that businesses adopt to grow revenue and increase profitability. Some impose severe budget cuts to decrease costs. Some streamline their product and service lines.

A common strategy I observed many consultancies adopt when looking to grow or anticipating challenging economic periods iscreating new services to catch more opportunities.

I consider this a mistake. Why? Let me explain in this article.

## The mood of "uncertainty"

Undoubtedly, 2024 has been a demanding year for business development in consulting.

Most consultancies I talked with admitted that closing consulting deals is  more difficult and takes more time than expected.

Adding new services is an understandable reaction (I’ve been there), BUT it’s also a risky game to play for four reasons:

• Clarity:It comes with the genuine risk of abandoning the clarity and simplicity consultancies had when their positioning and service offering was laser-sharp and more focused;

• Resources:It forces consultancies to spread internal resources too thin. This, in turn, risks weakening the expertise levels and causing decreased client satisfaction in existing projects;

• Validation:It lacks market validation (market fit of the service). Consultancies risk investing much work to get the new services going without even testing/piloting the value proposition – a bad habit in consulting.

• Profit:It decreases near-term profit. It might take a year (or even longer) to make a new service profitable. This doesn’t improve the financial situation. More often than not, it negatively impacts the near-term financial position of a consultancy.

*Recommended reading:Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies*

## It takes two years for a new service to mature

Developing a new service is like launching a new business on a smaller scale.It requires studying the target audience, identifying service gaps, determining the best value proposition to address pain points, and building processes, delivery methodologies, and marketing and business development campaigns.

In my experience, maturing a new service typically takes around two years.What is a mature service (at least, how I assess it)?

• it consistently delivers >50% gross margin

• it has a stable pipeline of new projects (revenue reliability)

Why does it take 2 years to mature? Because of...

• Developing a crystal clear value propositionthat is issue-led and outcome-driven for a specific target audience

• Creating a signature methodology,including a discovery service, a delivery roadmap, and a client development journey definition

• Establishing a solid client baseand building trust within the expertise domain and ensuring revenue and pipeline stability step by step

• Ensuring proper training and skill developmentfor team members to deliver the new service in a high-quality way consistently

• Testing and refining all processesmultiple times, validating them with client feedback, and documenting them as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

• Reaching full service-market fitwith a well-defined business development and marketing approach

• Leveraging all the project learnings to establish differentiating thought leadershipto educate, inspire, build trust at scale, and improve the inbound motion to improve client attraction organically

I’ve seen boutique consultancy owners struggle to give a new service enough time and refinement.Many either scrap it altogether or launch it at full scale without proper validation and processes, which can result in a painful drain on resources and overall margin erosion.

## Why staying focused is particularly important to break through the revenue growth ceiling

Focus is the only way to get the genuinely tremendous results that will make a consultancy top of mind with its prospects. Boutique consultancies that offer a wide range of services and market to a wide range of prospects will invariably attract many clients who aren’t a great fit.

This is particularly dangerous if a consultancy faces financial uncertainty.

In this day and age, buyers understand that they will get the most value for their needs from a highly specialized consultancy. This means that those offering a wide range of services will have to compete for much more on prices.

## Three ways of growing revenue in a sustainable manner

So what should boutique consultancies do to grow their revenue?

I recommend that instead of adding brand new, unexplored, unvalidated services, consulting leaders protect the consultancy's positioning and grow the revenue of existing services using the following three methods.

### 1. Crossing the sward with the longer sales cycle by doing these five things:

• ImprovingWin Rates(outcome-driven proposals are gold);

• Improving theAverage Deal Value(however, with the risk of becoming ‘too big to close’, see next point);

• Avoiding long deal-closingdiscussions by chunking up the project into smaller parts (easier to decide and digest but with the risk of decreased overall deal value, see previous point);

• Increasing theNumber of Opportunitiesin the pipeline (and implementing a rigid pipeline follow-up as of now);

• Avoiding doing projects that arenot a good fit, as it might take much longer to build trust in the expertise, with longer sales cycles as a result (and most likely with lower pricing).

### 2. Extending the existing services or expertise in a vertical way to protect the market positioning

This approach refers to the practice of developing new and deeper components of already existing consulting services, as opposed to creating entirely new services. By moving away from order-taker requests (in front of the wall) and developing new and deeper components of existing services, consulting firms can move upstream, differentiate themselves from competitors, command higher prices and margins, position themselves as trusted advisors to their clients, and improve client retention.

Here are a few examples of what I have been doing myself or together with my clients to deepen or extend existing services:

• Developing a discovery audit (to get projects started faster or provide a more accessible entry point);

• Agreeing on retainer fees to support CEO/CXO implementing existing/recent projects (I find this 1-2-1 support an easy sell);

• Offering '100 days support' for newly hired CXO of existing clients (and helping them deal with recent/existing projects);

• Helping existing clients with capability building, supporting the development of the existing team, maybe even providing support with interviewing, onboarding, etc., of new team members;

• Literacy development: improving the client’s literacy skills in, e.g., data, digital, transformation, risk, etc., if this would fit into recent/existing projects;

• Providing training and education on relevant topics such as project management, business strategy, or industry-specific technology trends or issues related to recent/existing projects;

• Offering ongoing support, maintenance, or audits for recently completed projects to ensure that implementation or adoption is running smoothly;

• Conducting regular check-ins to assess satisfaction with current/existing services and identify areas where the consultancy can improve. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one meetings (ideal ‘moments of truth’ to suggest additional support);

• Developing a customer success program to identify and address any issues or challenges clients proactively may face with existing services;

• Bundling existing consulting services: bundling related services together can create a sense of value for the client and make it easier for them to justify the purchase. An example from my work: offering to develop a specific KPI dashboard to monitor project progress (and maintaining the dashboard).

• Offering additional service customization: upselling can also be done by introducing additional customization options to existing clients. This can help to demonstrate the value of these additional services and make them more appealing to the client—an example from my work: integrating external customer research/interviews in the project.

*Recommended reading:Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy*

### 3. Productization of existing services

I have always been a big fan of the productization of consulting services. For boutique consultancies, this is another way of avoiding creating brand-new services and building on existing services or expertise.

Productization of consulting services can extend existing services by creating a standardized, repeatable process or framework that can be easily replicated and scaled.

This allows the consulting firm to focus on delivering the core service to multiple clients rather than constantly developing new services for each client.

Productization can also lead to cost savings and improved efficiency, which can be passed on to clients through lower fees or faster delivery times. There's a lot of pricing pressure in the markets, so that productization efficiencies might help now.

By productizing consulting services, companies can maintain focus on their core competencies while increasing scalability and profitability.

## But Luk, we love the variation in our work...

And that's how many consultancies I meet justify creating new services all the time.

Heck. Variation is not a consulting strategy, and variation doesn’t sell.

I hear this ‘we love variation’ almost every week. And that’s why most consulting leaders and their consultancies go unnoticed. With their generic and shortsighted diversification approach, they fail to connect with prospects and/or to leave a lasting impression.

Rather than blending in with the crowd, a consultancy should strive to stand out with its focused, deep expertise by igniting a spark and burning brighter than the competition.Variation in consulting is exciting at first. I get that. But to be honest, it’s wearing off over time. Then, fatigue hits the road. A narrow focus is maybe dull at first but becomes more exciting over time. People start inviting the expert consultancy that knows (almost) everything, has the most compelling data, can spot intriguing patterns, explain fascinating solutions, gets admired for thought-provoking ideas, and doesn’t need to sell or convince.Variation is tiring and is not the most sustainable strategy for revenue growth for boutique consultancies. For large multinational consultancies? Sure. But boutique consultancies lack the resources to make it a sustainable practice. They lack the people with the right expertise and the sufficient depth of expertise, the infrastructure, and the marketing bandwidth.

> "Most consulting leaders keep all options open, reject focus, and never become experts. They fear losing opportunities, and they are scared to make the jump to deep expertise. Their ego tells them not to narrow because they believe they can crush everything. So, in their heads, they are stuck. That’s terribly tiring. I’ve been there. With burnout as a result."Recommended reading:Why One-Stop-Shop Consultancies Are Bound to Be Low-Performing

*Recommended reading:Why One-Stop-Shop Consultancies Are Bound to Be Low-Performing*

## Takeaway: adapting without diffusing the focus

I always urge boutique consultancies to consistently audit their positioning, services, and market fit, adjusting when necessary.

This exercise will help consulting leaders to avoid going down the rabbit hole of adding additional services from scratch to create new revenue streams. This is risky in the short term and can damage the market positioning and business strategy in the long run.

Instead, I recommend that consulting leaders expand revenue-generation opportunities by digging even deeper into their niche areas of expertise by identifying improvement opportunities and upselling clients in the context of existing services.

Consultancies should focus on looking for new ways to expand on the value of their existing expertise instead of creating new services and, as a result, weaken their market positioning and near-term profit.

Consultancies must consider that before starting (expensive) new service experimentation.

# What Persuades Clients to Hire a Boutique Consultancy?

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 26 October 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/dump-the-buzzwords-what-actually-persuades-clients-to-hire-a-boutique-consultancy

---

“Luk, how is our Mission & Vision statement on our homepage?” A consultancy owner asked me this question a while ago.My answer: “Why don’t you just delete that from your consultancy’s homepage because nobody really cares?”As mean as it sounded, this is indeed the case. I see many consultancies proudly displaying their mission and vision type of content - often on top of their homepage - thinking this will positively influence prospects. While internally important, this messaging is externally meaningless.This is just one example of what way too many boutique consultancies think prospects pay attention to, but prospects have absolutely zero interest in it.

Another example would be boring messaging about 'the high standards of quality they always aspire to' or 'how agile their approach to each client is'.My take? These are just table stakes that every prospect expects from their potential business partner. It doesn't persuade them to hire that boutique consultancy.

## How prospects start their consultancy journey

There are all sorts of ways in which decision-makers or their team members come across consultancies and then learn more about them:

• Through Google search when looking for answers to specific questions and through general Google search for a particular consultancy and its leaders;

• Through social media like LinkedIn, where consultancies’ thought leaders offer practical, insightful advice that’s relevant to the prospect’s pain point, as well as their profiles;

• By getting a recommendation from a current/former colleague or another network member;

• By attending an industry event where the consultancy’s leader is presenting;

• By looking at the company’s website: homepage, service, the client testimonials, the blog, the FAQ section

• Through case studies or other readily available forms of social proof

• By subscribing to newsletters

What are they looking to establish through this independent preliminary review?

87% of clientssay trustis more important for their purchasing decisions in consulting services due to COVID!They want to see (1) if the consultancy is a right fit for their specific needs and (2) whether the consultancy’s expertise and service delivery can be trusted.Sourceresearchindicates, “Consulting firms that succeed will be those with propositions that deliver faster, better solutions.” Here is a helpful chart bySourcethat shows how buyers think when evaluating potential business partners among consultancies.

*Recommended reading:Consultancies Must Rethink the Way Their Prospects Buy*

## Eliminating the fluff

Don’t get me wrong; vision and value statements are essential to building the internal culture. They should be thoughtfully approached and adhered to internally. They should unite the team and inspire it—at least if those statements are genuine and not written by ChatGPT.However, boutique consultancies should make no mistake – they have nearly zero business development value. That’s not what “closes the deal”.

Similarly, I’ve seen many boutique consultancies put a lot of effort into and allocate a significant portion of their digital real estate to ‘boring table stakes’. Here, I’m talking about run-of-the-mill messaging like:

• high-quality service delivery

• experienced teams

• innovative approaches

• strong client relationships

• operating with agility and flexibility

• sustainable and ethical practices

To name a few… (I get told 100s of these).

These are just table stakes! Boutique consultancies cannot make a difference by explaining that they have an experienced team with superb client relationships. That’s really basic stuff, and everybody says it, unfortunately. It’s expected by prospects as a given.

Similar to vision and mission statements, these values and standards are crucial for internal cohesion but offer minimal—if any—benefit in business development.

To reiterate, a consultancy cannot set itself apart by boasting about its team's experience. This would imply they compete with other consultancies lacking experience, which is simply not the case!

## What prospects look for during the evaluation stage

So if vision and mission statements and table stakes rhetoric don’t impress prospects, then what does?Here are the four foundational elements I’ve observed consultancy buyers give the most weight to in their decision-making process.

### #1. Crystal clear specialisation and value proposition

Clients want to have their problems solved by those with deep expertise. Specialists can achieve, in general, significantly stronger results, understand specific problems with higher granularity, and provide support in a more efficient manner than jack-of-all-trades consultancies.So, one of the first things that prospects evaluate is whether a consultancy appears to be the right match in its area of expertise.“You won’t get what you want unless you are what you want” is what I like to tell my consultancy clients when evaluating their business strategies.Here is what I mean. More than ever before, the consultancy market is crowded, noisy, and challenging. Most consultancies are easily replaceable because they don’t have the deep expertise to solve high-value client problems. They might get hired because of their pricing or friendly order-taker profile, not because they’re the best in their field.

To create a different reality, consultancies must be clear about what they want and what/who they are. This clarity should then be distilled into a value proposition—one that clearly presents the firm's differentiation, strength, and ability to resolve high-value problems.Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design

### #2. Proprietary, proven methodologies, processes, or frameworks

The consultancies that lead the pack have developed their own methods, processes or tools – approaches that have been honed over time and can tackle challenges in ways others haven't even thought of.They can do that by focusing on a narrow set of problems and engaging in repetitive processes. Over time, this allows them to perfect processes and develop signature methodologies. Applying these signature methodologies becomes a highly efficient process that delivers predictable results.And that’s what clients want – predictability and robust results. They want to see the highest possible ROI and the lowest possible risk.

For many years, I totally underestimated the business development power of a signature methodology. That was until I met a boutique consultancy owner who won a 180k more expensive pitch (against a Big 4 consulting firm) with their signature methodology as the core of their pitch.I wrote this LinkedIn postabout what I learned from this pitch.Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy

### #3. Measurable and predictable results, proven by client testimonials

The real differentiators are those consultancies that can point to clear, quantifiable outcomes from their engagements – results that meet and exceed client expectations, backed by glowing, outcome-based testimonials and use cases. Not by those fluffy testimonials like 'they were very nice to work with' but 'here's what we could achieve with the support of [consultancy X]'.Knowing that a consultancy has already applied its signature methodology and frameworks to dozens of similar clients with similar problems in the past and consistently achieved strong results provides peace of mind—guarantees of sorts. The prospect will have trust that the consultancy is not just winging it.Recommended reading:The Best Consulting Pitch I’ve Ever Seen

### #4. Education and original research

In my experience, leading consultancy firms contribute to advancing their (narrow) field through publishing cutting-edge use cases, proprietary research, insightful data, or analysis of specific trends and lessons learned from previous (similar) projects.

Prospects know that, too. According to the2024 Edelman-LinkedIn study, 73% of decision-makers say that an organisation’s thought leadership content is a more trustworthy basis for assessing its capabilities than marketing materials.

The same study found that 70% of C-suite executives said that thought leadership had led them to reconsider their current vendor relationship, and 54% realised that other vendors might better understand their challenges and needs due to the thought leadership.Recommended reading:Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting Business

## In conclusion

What I would like for boutique consultancies to take away from this article is two-fold:

• From a business development standpoint, there is a distinction between what is essential internally and what matters externally. The two don’t necessarily overlap. A vision, mission statement, and values are internally relevant foundational elements. However, they do little for business development.

• Externally important messaging resonates with prospects the most when it engages them through educational content, builds trust through social proof, and shows how working with the consultancy minimises the risk and increases the value (and the possible outcomes) for the prospect.

Understanding what consulting service buyers are truly looking for is crucial for boutique consultancies aiming to stand out in a crowded market. So, I invite boutique consultancy owners to objectively examine their consultancy and adjust their messaging accordingly.

# How a Boutique Consultancy Can Escape the Toxic Chasing of New Clients

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 15 October 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-boutique-consultancy-can-escape-toxic-chasing-of-new-clients

---

I encounter the same story almost weekly: boutique consultancy firms with a fragmented service portfolio trying to be everything to everyone.They stretch their limited capacity thin and never get beyond small-ticket, one-trick pony consulting projects.As a result, they’re stuck in a vicious cycle of constantly chasing new clients, leaving no time or bandwidth to develop long-term, profitable relationships with existing ones.They keep inventing new services in a misguided attempt to land more significant projects and revenue, diluting their expertise and credibility even more.It’s disheartening to watch, and it happens far too often.The good news is that, like most vicious cycles in business, it can be broken with enough determination, strong internal alignment, discipline, and the right strategy.Attracted clients thrive. Chased clients drain.

## Chasing clients today will be a problem tomorrow

Before I dive into the solution—the steps a boutique consultancy can take to break the vicious cycle—I’d like to go over some of the most toxic consequences of relying on client chasing (vs. attracting) for business development.

• More non-ideal clients: If a boutique consultancy has to chase its clients, it likely says yes to many non-ideal prospects to stay afloat, leading to poor fit, mismatched expectations, and more headaches than wins. Chasing clients leads to regret, not results.

• Poor differentiation: Chasing new clients with a fragmented portfolio makes the consultancy indistinguishable. This usually results in more project complications and fewer process standardisation and productisation opportunities, draining the team’s resources in the long run. And not to forget: it erodes expertise perception.

• Reputation damage: Constantly chasing clients and working with non-ideal prospects can lead to suboptimal project outcomes. As a result, the consultancy may develop a reputation for inconsistent quality and impact. I’m not even going to mention that chasing clients is usually a red flag for prospects. I guess you don’t like all the ‘chasing emails’ in your inbox, either?

• Lower win rates: Win rates will drop if the consultancy lacks specific expertise. Scattergun targeting and vague market positioning don’t build trust or attract quality clients.

• Higher CAC: Chasing clients is expensive. Client acquisition costs (CAC) pile up as marketing, business development, and sales efforts are wasted on prospects who aren’t truly aligned with the consultancy’s services, resulting in a low ROI and inefficient use of resources.

• Poor client retention: It's a well-known statistic. Chased clients rarely stay long enough to develop profitable, long-term relationships.

• Pricing erosion: Chasing leads to pricing squeezes and lengthy, sometimes gruelling negotiations, often ending with unfavourable contract terms and extended payment cycles.

• Unreliable pipeline: If a consultancy is constantly chasing, its new project pipeline becomes unreliable, leading to chaotic revenue and cash forecasts, project planning and resource management. An unreliable pipeline makes it nearly impossible to staff and schedule effectively.

• Weak EVP: With a broad, unfocused portfolio and a constant scramble to chase clients, attracting and retaining top experts becomes harder. The consultancy appears reactive and generic rather than an attractive go-to expert in any field.

• Stifled innovation: When a consultancy is always in reactive mode, chasing clients and working on poorly aligned projects, there’s little room to innovate or develop proprietary methodologies and processes.

Fast forward two years: the consultancy owner hits burnout, and half of the overstretched team has left. This short-sighted, self-destructive mindset leads these consultancies nowhere, yet it’s a trap too many fall into.

## Escaping the vicious cycle through intentional design

High-performing consultancies are intentionally designed rather than spontaneously occurring. Their foundations are purposefully crafted, and their operational framework reinforces their strategic choices.

I wholeheartedly believe that any average boutique consultancy can transform into a high-performing one that delivers outstanding client results.I’ve seen it happen. I’ve experienced the impact of intentional design in consulting businesses first-hand. It’s not easy, but there is a blueprint.Here are the critical components of intentional design I have experienced in the past decade that will enable boutique consultancies to transition from client-chasing business development strategies to the path of organic growth, where prospects seek out the consultancy’s services (client attraction - strong inbound motion).

• High degree of expertise specificity: Focusing on a well-defined area of expertise that caters to specific client problems or struggles will make the consultancy the go-to choice for particular types of clients or projects. It’s about becoming the go-to expert for specific challenges and becoming ‘the reference’.

• Unique, client-centric value proposition: The most compelling value propositions I’ve encountered are highly specific to a specific target audience, addressing their pain points and desired outcomes (issue-led and outcome-based). They are short, laser-sharp, and impactful.

• Outcome-driven social proof: Flipping the script and getting prospects to come to you requires showcasing the transformative outcomes of the consultancy’s client work. This is best achieved through case studies, client stories, and testimonials – all communicated in a way that puts outcomes and the value the consultancy delivers front and centre.

• Innovative discovery and entry services: Offering targeted, value-driven entry-point services that provide immediate insights and build trust with potential clients is a proven method for developing the inbound motion.

• Service design centred around client development: Once a prospect becomes a new client through a discovery/entry service, I encourage consultancies to foster and grow that relationship to establish long-term cooperation. Consultancies that derive most of their revenue from existing clients through recurring work aren’t as desperate to chase new clients.Here's a LinkedIn postabout 'Programmatic Client Success Journey Design'.

• Differentiating signature methodology: Developing a unique and recognisable approach to problem-solving will distinguish the consultancy from competitors.

• High qualification barriers: I urge boutique consultancies to establish rigorous standards that potential clients must meet. This will maintain engagement quality and reinforce the external and internal alignment with the consultancy's expertise.

• Visible leading experts in the market: Positioning the consultancy's key members as recognised thought leaders through public speaking, published insights, and active participation in industry events will go a long way in shaping the market narrative. As I always say:"Business development success in consulting is rooted in educating the target audience.'

• Internal alignment: Intentional design will not work until every senior leader, partner, or owner is aligned around the same parameters. Only by putting 100% of the force behind the strategy will the consultancy be able to push the rock up the mountain effectively.

I have yet to meet a high-performing consultancy that stumbled into their status.There are no coincidences, no luck, no right timing. Every single consultancy I’ve spoken to, audited or worked with achieved its high-performing status through an unwavering commitment to see through a strategy based on the intentional design components I just listed.Yes, it often takes a couple of years to see the results. But it does work. I’ve been there myself twice.

## In conclusion, escaping the client chase trap

Breaking free from the toxic cycle of client chasing requires a fundamental shift in how a consultancy is set up for success.By focusing on intentional design, consultancies can stop chasing and start attracting the right clients. It’s not an overnight process.The journey from reactive to proactive, from chasing to being sought after, is challenging but absolutely achievable.It’s a path paved with focus, discipline, internal alignment, and perseverance, and it turns consultancies into high-performing businesses that thrive in the long run.If you’re chasing clients, you’re chasing headaches.Two words to take away: Intentional design.

# Is The Entrepreneurial Mindset Compatible With Managing a Boutique Consultancy?

About 40-50% of boutique consultancy owners I meet have a solid entrepreneurial profile.

Their characteristics are their infinite search for new opportunities, high-risk acceptance, relentless pursuit of innovation, and personal investment in almost every aspect of the business.Many boutique consultancy founders share entrepreneurial qualities such as the drive to create something of their own, the ability to inspire others and form teams around a shared goal, and the grit it takes to overcome the tough odds that any new business faces.

These qualities are necessary for anyone deciding to leave the comfort zone of working for an established business and venture out independently.As much as these entrepreneurial qualities deserve recognition and praise, I’ve also noticed that they are often juxtaposed with the realities of running a successful boutique consulting business and the focus it requires.One of my clients – Tom Frame, co-founder ofEtch Consulting– commented on aLinkedIn postabout hyper-specialisation and project repetition - which are vital to the success of a boutique consulting business. Tom:“It is easier said than done and takes serious discipline that often is at odds with the raw state of entrepreneurism.”I’ve encountered this chasm between entrepreneurial spirit, and the hyper-focus a boutique consulting business requires enough times that I wanted to address it more in-depth. This article is about that.

## Why entrepreneurs might struggle in the boutique consultancy ecosystem

Certain characteristics of entrepreneurship are a must to run a boutique consultancy business. I can’t argue with that.

• The drive to venture out on their ownis how most new businesses – boutique consultancies included – are founded in the first place. It takes courage, a healthy amount of ego and confidence, and a vision to leave the safety of a current job and create something from scratch.

• The grit and persistencethat any new business will test the founders on are essential for the viability of the consulting business.

• The determination to grow a serviceand make it a viable offering is not to be taken for granted. It’s not easy, yet it is essential for establishing and growing a boutique consultancy.

• The ambition and aspirationsare the drivers behind boutique consultancy businesses. Exploring the unexplored, wanting to achieve new professional heights, and building a team in the process—all of these characteristics provide boutique consultancy owners withexcellent service.

Yet, there is a flip side to this entrepreneurial coin.

Many qualities that create admirable and successful entrepreneurs can simultaneously limit a boutique consultancy's ability to grow sustainably and achieve the desirable performance levels.

• The ego: The same confidence propelling many entrepreneurs to venture independently can also significantly impact decision-making. Making assumptions and then determining a strategy based on these assumptions pose serious risks.

• Failing to say no: Taking on any incoming requests in the spirit of “Of course, we can handle this!” – another ego-driven behaviour that I personally fell victim to in the early days of my consulting career – dilutes the focus and expertise of a boutique consultancy business.

• The impatience: Ambition and aspirations sometimes go hand-in-hand with impatience and the temptation to take a shortcut. High-performing consultancies, on the other hand, are built on discipline and unwavering commitment to repetition.

• Opportunity seekers: The infinite drive for innovation and opportunity creation is something I’ve observed among all entrepreneur-owners. While many dread juggling a hundred different tasks and responsibilities, I’ve witnessed many entrepreneurs derive joy from not having a “boring routine”. Fast-paced environments, shaping new concepts or opportunities, and achieving new wins are fuel for many. Repetition of similar projects, on the other hand, is inherently the opposite of this type of variety.

## Reconciling the spirit of entrepreneurship with the demands of building a high-performance boutique consultancy

I see this tension between the entrepreneurial spirit and the demands of creating a high-performance consultancy in three main areas. While not easy, I believe it’s possible to channel entrepreneurial qualities in a way that would reconcile the inherent chasm.

### #1. Developing a signature methodology through repetition

You can't scale what you can't repeat.

A signature methodology is a unique and proprietary approach developed by a consultancy to solve specific problems or address particular challenges their clients face. This methodology encapsulates the consultancy's expertise, processes, and best practices distilled into a structured framework.A signature methodology allows boutique consultancies to compete against the Big 4s of the world. It is what sets these consultancies apart from competitors.However, a signature methodology is only robust when it delivers outstanding results. To develop a methodology like this, a boutique consultancy has to commit to repetition – in the types of clients it works with, the types of projects it takes on, and the kinds of pain points it tries to address.This repetition pays off in many ways:

• It reduces costs as processes get standardised and optimised over time, delivery efficiency dramatically improves

• It allows boutique consultancies to increase their prices as their methodology and outcomes improve over time and become a proprietary differentiation asset

• Increased revenue and reduced costs lead to higher profits

• It continuously deepens expertise in a narrow field, making that expertise increasingly valuable. It grows the expertise reputation in the market

• It makes internal processes – e.g., hiring and training employees, proposal writing and pitching, client onboarding and project delivery, account management and development – to name a few - more streamlined and efficient.

While the entrepreneurial nature of some boutique consultancy owners may be entirely at odds with the notion of repetition – day in and day out – I would argue that it means that the actual benefits of repetition just haven’t been uncovered yet.Repetition and variety are not necessarily the opposites. Repetition offers immense growth opportunities. However, repetition facilitates narrowly focused growth instead of trying to grow in a broad way by adding new disconnected services and expanding the target audience.

Deep focus and expertise development can help to uncover a profound spectrum of problems and patterns and enable:

• the continuous enhancement and precision tuning of the delivery of existing services (methodology, processes,...);

• the creation of, e.g. vertically integrated services that build seamlessly on existing offerings (see my articleabout vertical service integration);

• the development of adjacent (new) services that are well-aligned with the overarching expertise and positioning of the consultancy;

• the adaptation and refining of existing services to maintain cutting-edge relevance as new technologies (e.g. AI) or frameworks emerge.

I keep sharing my experiences with focus, repetition, and pattern detection with my clients. Here's what I usually say:

"There is a lot of variety that stems from repetition. However,it is different from the type of variety that entrepreneurs typically are searching for."Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy

### #2. Giving new services time to mature

In my experience, maturing a new service typically takes around two years and involves:

• Developing a crystal clear value proposition that is issue-led and outcome-driven for a specific target audience

• Creating a signature methodology including a discovery service, a delivery roadmap, and a client development journey definition

• Establishing a solid client base and building trust within the expertise domain and ensuring revenue and pipeline stability step by step

• Ensure proper training and skill development for team members to deliver the new service in a high-quality way consistently

• Testing and refining all processes multiple times, validating them with client feedback, and documenting them as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

• Reaching full service-market fit with a well-defined business development and marketing approach

• Leveraging all the project learnings to establish differentiating thought leadership to educate, inspire, build trust at scale, and improve the inbound motion to improve client attraction organically

I’ve seen boutique consultancy owners struggle with giving a new service enough time and refinement. Many either scrap it altogether or launch it at full scale without proper validation and processes, which results in a painful drain of resources and overall margin erosion.I strongly encourage boutique consultancy owners in this position to tap into their grit. Developing a new service is like launching a new business on a smaller scale. It requires studying the target audience, identifying service gaps, determining the best value proposition to address pain points, and building processes, delivery methodologies, and marketing and business development campaigns.Recommended reading:Do You Need New Consulting Services to Grow Revenue?

### #3. Learning to say no to distractions and prioritising accordingly

As mentioned, most entrepreneurs strive for variety and constantly search for new opportunities. It’s the fuel that propels them. The excitement of every day being different, never quite knowing what to expect from every interaction – these are characteristics of entrepreneurial life that some boutique consultancy owners may not want to part with.

This love for variety and new opportunities – combined with a high degree of self-confidence and/or ego – can manifest in a couple of destructive ways:

• Taking on any project because of the ego-driven mentality that says there is nothing the consultancy can’t handle: This FOMO-based attitude results in a diluted value proposition and drastically lowers the ROI of marketing and business development efforts. When there is no solid portfolio of social proof to demonstrate excellence in a niche offering, marketing messages fail to find the right audience and build trust at scale.

• Failing to prioritise and weaken foundational elements: There are certain pillars within a consultancy business that consultancy owners need to get right. Here, I’m talking about value propositions. I’m talking about the reputational footprint. I’m referring to creating well-defined boundaries for the types of problems and audiences a consultancy caters to. Everything else is built on these pillars. And if the foundation is weak, the business is at a significant risk of failure in the long run.

That’s why I urge consultancy owners to think long and hard about what to prioritise and put most of the effort into. While that reduces the daily variety, it’s critical to ensuring long-term viability and success.And here’s the thing about short-term variety: more often than not, it leads to the feeling of burnout. Entrepreneurs are not exempt from that. It is one thing to power through unreasonable schedules for a year, for two, for five. It’s a different story when the hamster wheel appears to be never-ending.Recommended reading:How Boutique Consultancy Owners Can Reclaim Their Quality of LifeFurthermore, an unchecked ego leads to making assumptions yet failing to test them.In running a consulting firm, such refusal to test assumptions can lead to more dire consequences: a failed service launch, misallocation of resources, inefficient processes, overworked staff, unhappy clients, and, ultimately, the failure of the entire business.Now, a healthy amount of ego is good. It’s often a prerequisite to finding a business. In interactions with prospects, boutique consultancy owners should be able to exude a certain amount of confidence to facilitate building trust.However, I’ve encountered many entrepreneurs who fail to control their egos. I used to be one of them. In my early consulting years, I used to call the office with the message: you won’t believe what I just sold. The answer of the team: “damn, did you do that again?” I was proud to sell projects we had never done before. My ego wanted to crush every new opportunity that came my way.My ego caused me to overestimate my expertise and underestimate the impact ‘selling-without-experience’ had on the team.What is the downside of an ego-driven approach and operating on untested assumptions? There are many, including:

• Positioning erosion

• Toxicity in the company’s culture

• Service dilution

• Failed service launches

• Unhappy clients

• Lack of social proof

• Lack of reputational footprint

• Lack of referrals

• Lack of trust by prospective clients

My advice to consultancy owners with whom this resonates is to:

• Channelling all that ego into striving to be the best in a narrow set of services

• Balancing being bold and innovative with doing the due diligence of testing and validating

• Being diligent about collecting and analysing data

• Searching for opportunities that the data reveals within the narrow scope of the business focus

• Building a boutique consultancy to win bids for signature projects against massive multinational consultancies.

Winning in the deep instead of bleeding in the broad.Recommended reading:How a Consultancy Can Get Crushed by the Ego of Its Owners

## In conclusion: Can entrepreneurs run a boutique consultancy?

Of course, they can. But...

The journey from entrepreneurship to building a successful boutique consultancy is both challenging and rewarding. It demands a delicate balance between the entrepreneur's pioneering spirit and the disciplined focus required for boutique consultancy performance.While entrepreneurial traits like boldness, creativity, and risk-taking are invaluable in getting a business off the ground, they can also create significant risks when not tempered by a structured approach to growth and service delivery.To bridge this chasm, consultancy owners must embrace the power of disciplined repetition to develop signature methodologies and processes, be patient with maturing a new service, learn to say no to distractions and keep egos in check.Boutique consultancies can achieve high performance and sustained success by grounding their entrepreneurial drive in the principles of specialisation and consistent execution.

# How Boutique Consultancy Owners Can Reclaim Their Quality of Life

---

Here is a typical story of how boutique consultancies get started.You have outstanding experts working for a large consulting firm. Over the years, they have acquired deep expertise. Their clients are happy. They’ve established strong connections in the industry and earned an excellent reputation for their excellence in work.Some of these consultants decide to take control of their schedules and client work and start a boutique consultancy firm.They start 'hassling' in their pursuit of growth and quick wins. They take on almost every project or opportunity that comes their way. They just started a new business, so securing as many clients as possible for them makes sense!They start hiring people to help work on all these different projects. However, it seems that the ‘hassle’ and the ‘grind’ never stop. Instead of working on the business and setting up strategic goals, these boutique consultancy owners are constantly working in the trenches of the consultancy business. I get that. I’ve been there.They deliver client projects, develop business, manage the project pipeline and CRM, prepare client contracts and invoices, post on social media, hire and train new consultants, join calls with prospects, attend events, and do dozens of other things.After a couple of years, they start feeling frustrated. Maybe even tired. What initially was the desire to take control over their schedules and consulting business has now turned into a never-ending cycle of putting out fires and trying to keep the business afloat.Their quality of life is at an all-time low.How did this happen? Why did these consultancy owners get stuck in this vicious loop? And is there a way out?

## The allure and the trap

The reason I’m writing this article is because I’ve been there.

I was ensnared in the whirlwind of my boutique consultancy in my early consulting years. The excitement of saying yes to every project that came my way was exhilarating. Word had spread that I started my consultancy and got project requests quickly. How thrilling!Unfortunately, my ego was also my demise and, in hindsight, a blessing as it forced me to take a step back and radically change my approach.Recommended reading:How a Consultancy Can Get Crushed by the Ego of Its OwnersHowever, I took on every client that contacted me for a while there. It was the allure of being able to pick my clients and being in demand, the allure of running my own business and thinking I’ll have all the freedom in the world.

But that’s where the trap lies. I wasn’t really picking my clients. I was saying yes to every opportunity, irrespective of how neatly aligned it was with my immediate area of expertise.

I justified it by saying that I love the variety in consulting work—every day is different, right? Nothing is boring about that!Here’s the thing. After a while, the joy of variation fades. The stress that comes with constantly juggling a hundred different tasks for dozens of clients without a possibility of a more balanced life on the horizon stays.It’s a trap!

> "I hear this ‘I love variation’ almost every week. And that’s why most consulting leaders and their consultancies go unnoticed. Their generic and uninspired approach fails to connect with prospects and/or leave a lasting impression."

"I hear this ‘I love variation’ almost every week. And that’s why most consulting leaders and their consultancies go unnoticed. Their generic and uninspired approach fails to connect with prospects and/or leave a lasting impression."

Unfortunately, many boutique consultancy owners come to me when they already spent a few years in that trap – overworked, overextended, disillusioned.Fortunately, there is a way out.

## The power of narrow positioning

One of the first things I do in my work with boutique consulting firms is review and discuss the consultancy's positioning.

What is their place in the crowded and highly competitive marketplace? What problems do they solve for their clients, and how do they communicate that?Unsurprisingly, there is almost always a direct link between the quality and specificity of a consultancy's positioning and performance. The more fragmented the service offering (and that's unfortunately often the case) and the more varied the work, the more the consultancy struggles.“Luk, why narrow? I love solving diverse problems in my work”.That’s the ‘official story’ that I hear a lot. These consultancy owners and leaders are fooling themselves. This variation is a distraction that comes at the expense of their quality of life (and their margins, you bet).The wider the range of services a consultancy offers and the more fragmented its target audience, the more unknowns there are.

Variation and fragmentation mean that each project is different. The resources required to deliver on this variation become unpredictable. So does the schedule. There is no standardisation of processes, no repetition, and poor project efficiency.

How could there be? When the demands of each project are different, there is no possible way to achieve a high level of efficiency!This is the remarkable strength of focused positioning.

• It enables consultancy owners to optimize processes. When there is minimal variation in work due to the consultancy solving the same types of problems for the same types of clients, the leaders can set up processes and systems that get optimized for maximum efficiency over time. I’m talking about every aspect – from onboarding clients to tracking progress to recruiting new consultants.

• It provides parameters for decision-making. Narrowing down positioning and sticking to it gives consulting leaders and owners a robust framework for determining which opportunities to say yes to and which ones to refuse. It allows boutique consultancies to eliminate distractions and focus on maximizing the value they deliver to clients within the narrow field of expertise, allowing them to increase the pricing.

• It enables consultancies to create their signature methodology.By focusing on a narrow field of expertise and consistently addressing similar challenges, consultancies can develop a unique and proprietary approach to problem-solving. This signature methodology becomes a hallmark of their brand, setting them apart from competitors. Over time, this methodology not only enhances the quality and consistency of their work but also becomes a valuable asset that clients recognize and seek out.

• It enables consultancies to build proprietary data sets.By leveraging their signature methodology and focusing on project repetition, companies can systematically narrow down the range of data points they aggregate from various clients. This consistent approach allows for the creation of exclusive, proprietary data sets, which add significant monetary value to the firm and help achieve premium pricing.

• It enhances the quality of life for many boutique consultancy owners.This approach grants them greater control over their schedules, client engagements, and business growth. While it might seem paradoxical, reducing options actually fosters more freedom. By focusing their efforts, consultancy owners and leaders can transition from being entrenched in daily operations to strategically steering their business, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling professional and personal life.

> "Strive for the narrowest possible positioning of your consultancy! Control your ego, you don’t need to crush everything. If you go to market trying to crush everything, the consultancy will play in the pricing rat race. And that’s the end of your quality of life."

"Strive for the narrowest possible positioning of your consultancy! Control your ego, you don’t need to crush everything. If you go to market trying to crush everything, the consultancy will play in the pricing rat race. And that’s the end of your quality of life."

## Deep expertise – the superpower in the world of consulting

Narrow positioning enables consulting firms to develop deep expertise. That’s what project repetition does.

The more a consultancy works on addressing the same types of pain points for the same narrowly defined target audience, the more knowledge it acquires about every aspect of those pain points. It can now see patterns, predict outcomes, and deliver truly transformational work for clients and their businesses.

And that’s what clients want! That’s what they are willing to pay premium fees for. They want exceptional experts who can see what the clients and their teams don’t and who can diagnose the root cause of their problem instead of working on a superficial level addressing symptoms.Deep expertise is a superpower. It's energizing and fulfilling. The basic formula here is as follows:

• Narrow focus is the path to repetition.

• Repetition is the path to expertise.

• Expertise is the path to value.

• Value is the path to premium pricing.

• Premium pricing is the path to profit.

• Profit is the path to quality of life.

*Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy*

And isn’t the quality of life the ultimate goal?

The freedom to confidently make business decisions, take a vacation and disconnect, enjoy time with loved ones, read a book, engage in sports, or devote time to a hobby—so many consultancy owners are striving for that balance in their lives!

I only work four days a week. That was my intention when I started my consulting business. My goal was to do meaningful work that would have a positive, transformational impact on my clients while, at the same time, having the time to enjoy all the other things I love – writing, cycling and mountain biking, for example.I knew the only way to do that was to eliminate distractions and make my work as efficient as possible. I’ve already experienced for the past decade what it feels like to run a consulting business when you say yes to every opportunity and overload yourself with variety, and what it’s like when you stay focused and develop deep expertise. I knew which path I didn’t want to repeat.Protecting my freedom, mental health, and quality of life is the foundation of my consultancy business model.And it works.That’s why I’m adamant in my message to boutique consultancies' owners and partners. I advise them to strive to narrow the consultancy's focus, specialize, and develop deep rather than broad expertise to break out of the vicious loop of unpredictability.To build a reputable name, a boutique consultancy must take bold and unconventional actions. It must be willing to shake things up, take risks, and push itself out of its ‘I-love-variation’ comfort zone.Rather than blending in with the crowd, a consultancy should strive to stand out with its focused, deep expertise by igniting a spark and burning brighter than the competition.Variation is tiring. And it doesn’t sell.

## Conclusion: Embracing the new narrative and state of mind

As consultancy owners and leaders navigate the challenges and opportunities of running their boutique consultancies, my advice is clear: They should embrace narrow positioning, develop deep expertise, control their ego, cherish their craft, streamline and standardize methodologies and processes, and prioritize their well-being to build a sustainable, profitable, and fulfilling business.By aligning their operations with their core values and passions, they can create a consultancy that thrives in the marketplace, enhances their quality of life, and contributes positively to their teams and clients.I didn’t invent this blueprint for success. I merely followed the path that so many other experts before me have already paved. It’s the path that was created by the market – deep expertise has been a game-changer for me.When we focus on working smarter, not harder, everything starts to fall into place. And when we focus on quality of life first, our work becomes more meaningful and fulfilling.

# Saying Yes to Non-Fit Projects with Existing Consulting Clients: Risks and Rewards

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 17 September 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/saying-yes-to-non-fit-projects-with-existing-consulting-clients

---

My stance on running a boutique consulting business is very clear: Establish a narrow focus, develop a very specific value proposition for a narrowly defined target audience, create a signature methodology, repeat it multiple times, and say no to all other non-fit projects.However, it would be remiss of me to make no room for exceptions. I’ve been there myself and it was always a difficult moment from a decision-making point of view.There are instances when accepting non-fit projects from existing clients is a good idea – in fact, under the right circumstances, doing so can come with significant long-term gains.So that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article: the nuances of determining whether to say yes to non-fit project requests from existing clients.

## The risks of accepting non-fit projects

Before I delve into the instances when non-fit projects might be a good idea, I’d like to quickly run through the main risks.

• Dilution of expertise: Consultancies that take on projects outside of their core expertise risk losing their specialisation edge and being seen as generalists.

• Strained resources and operational inefficiencies: Taking on non-fit projects generally means having to tap into additional resources, be it time, skills, or personnel. This places unnecessary burdens on teams, which, in turn, diminishes their productivity and can lead to burnout.

• Reduced quality of work and client satisfaction: Without the right expertise or resources, the consultancy risks delivering subpar value to their clients. This is especially damaging when it comes to existing clients.

• Lost opportunities: Saying yes to non-fit projects means taking away resources from potential perfect-fit projects. After all, there are only so many hours in the day.

• Setting a bad precedent: If a boutique consultancy says yes to one non-fit project, it risks setting a precedent both internally and externally. It will be that much more difficult to say no to the next non-fit project request from the same client without compromising the quality of the relationship. It will also invite other clients to request non-fit projects. And it risks eroding internal alignment.

*Recommended reading:9 Ways to Assess a Boutique Consultancy’s Expertise Reputation*

## When non-fit projects might indicate an opportunity

While, in general, I advocate against accepting non-fit projects (whether from new or existing clients), I also urge consultancies to look back and assess the nature of those requests. Here is why:

• Regular requests for non-fit projects could indicate a value proposition problem: Consultancies that regularly receive such requests – or at an increasing rate – could benefit from reassessing their value proposition. There is a good chance that it may not be clearly explained enough.This lack of clarity can result in clients making project requests outside of the parameters of the consultancy’s expertise/portfolio of services.It’s an opportunity for consultancies to go back to the drawing board and redesign their value proposition in a way that will make for more specificity and a stronger differentiation.

• Non-fit projects could signal a new trend/emerging market need: Sometimes, these non-fit requests could signal a new trend or a common struggle among clients. I advise that consultancy owners and leaders pay close attention. It is worth investing time into in-depth conversations with existing clients to determine whether it’s a one-off request or indeed an emerging market need.If it’s the latter, boutique consultancies are presented with an opportunity to develop and launch a new service – ideally, something that neatly aligns with the existing portfolio and can be vertically integrated.In these circumstances, I recommend that consultancies first organise a pilot project with a client or two to first explore these new areas. Then, it can be validated with a larger network of clients.

• Strategic acceptance for key accounts: Consultancy owners and leaders can sometimes consider making exceptions for crucial clients.However, this should be a carefully considered decision, followed by an open discussion with the client to ensure it's not just a habit of saying yes to everything, which can be detrimental.I see three reasons to step outside the narrowly defined parameters of work for key accounts:Opportunistic: Taking on the project might help keep the lights on when things aren't going well.Tactical: To please, retain, or develop a key client, a transparent discussion should be conducted explaining its exceptional nature.Validation: Carefully testing or piloting new waters.

• Opportunistic: Taking on the project might help keep the lights on when things aren't going well.

• Tactical: To please, retain, or develop a key client, a transparent discussion should be conducted explaining its exceptional nature.

• Validation: Carefully testing or piloting new waters.

## Three dimensions to consider before accepting non-fit project requests

Before saying yes to non-fit project requests from existing clients – or from new ones for that matter – I’d urge boutique consultancy owners and leaders to first think through the following dimensions:

• Resource allocation assessment: Before saying yes, it would be wise to evaluate whether the consultancy has the necessary resources and skills to deliver quality results without impacting its core services.

• Long-term impact: What are the potential long-term effects of taking on non-fit projects? Will it dilute the consultancy's core strengths or distract from its primary business goals?

• Repeatability assessment: If the project is a one-off requiring specialised resources that won't be fully utilised in the future, it’s better to decline politely. Taking on such projects may lead to inefficiencies and strain your team's capabilities. However, if it is something that could be replicated with other clients, there might be potential for service expansion.

## In conclusion

I believe that for boutique consultancies, maintaining a narrow focus and cultivating go-to expertise reputation are essential for long-term success.However, there are moments when stepping outside these established boundaries for non-fit projects may be worth the risk.The key lies in balance and discernment.

# Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy

(This article was updated on September 16, 2024)

“Variation in a boutique consulting doesn’t sell. Focus does.” I’ve said these words to my clients – boutique consultancies – more times than I can count.Let me clarify what I mean.I come across consultancies daily that offer a buffet of services. Their messaging is all about tailored solutions and hyper-customisable services. I get it. These consultancies try to show how customer-centric they are and want to cast as wide a net as possible.I consider that as a mistake. Variation is a boulder that weighs boutique consultancies down.Large firms – the Big 4s of the world – can afford to offer variation. These consultancies have endless resources and an army of consultants. They can provide a wide range of services because their internal pool of knowledge is massive. But that’s not the case for boutique consultancies.So why even try to compete against these large firms on variation? Consulting businesses with consulting teams of 30-100 people don’t stand a chance in such instances against consulting firms that employ thousands of consultants across multiple continents!The superpower that boutique consultancies can employ, however, is developing a signature methodology– a highly effective way of addressing high-value problems for a narrow audience with high predictability in outcomes.As I’ve witnessed countless times, the path to developing that signature methodology and becoming a high-performance consultancy is through an unwavering commitment to repetition.That’s what I’m going to elaborate on in this post.

## Signature methodology – what it is and why it matters

A signature methodology is a unique and proprietary approach developed by a consultancy to solve specific problems or address particular challenges their clients face. This methodology encapsulates the consultancy's expertise, processes, and best practices distilled into a structured framework.Let’s say two consultancies of approximately the same size bid for the same project – developing and implementing a sales forecasting system for a multinational fashion brand.Consultancy 1 markets itself as a one-stop shop for all digital sales and marketing needs for retail businesses. Consultancy 2, on the other hand, has a proprietary methodology for implementing sales forecasting systems for large fashion brands that consistently deliver forecasts with 95% accuracy. It has a track record to back up that claim.Which consultancy is the client more likely to book? The answer is obvious.That’s the power of a signature methodology. It creates trust with prospects – the impact of such consultancies’ work is typically exponentially higher, while the risks of hiring such firms are exponentially lower.Here are just a few reasons why a signature methodology for solving significant client problems is a driver of the success of high-performance boutique consultancies:

• It offers differentiation: A signature methodology distinguishes a consultancy from competitors by offering a distinct approach that has proven to deliver impactful results.

• It allows consultancies to demonstrate success: Building up on the point above since a signature methodology is implemented repeatedly will enable a consultancy to build up a library of successful case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.

• It leads to standardised processes and swift delivery, which equals maximum efficiency:Developing, refining, and deploying a signature methodology opens doors to efficiency gains. It allows consultancies to optimise their resources, technologies, processes, human capital, client onboarding, etc.

• It produces higher profit margins: The formula here is quite simple. High-impact results delivered with a signature methodology allow boutique consultancies to charge premium prices. Standardised processes and optimised efficiency reduce costs. I’ve worked with high-performance consultancies that reported 2x or 3x higher profit margins than the average in their industry.

• It reduces outcome variability and makes for happy clients: In a 2023 UK study, more than 50% of consulting firm clients felt that the value they receive in return for their payment doesn't match up (saysthis Harvard article). Implementing a signature methodology over and over and over again means consultancies can measure the outcomes and, when needed, tweak the method until they achieve minimal variability in outcomes.

• It reduces the time needed to onboard new consultants: New hires can hit the ground much faster when introduced to standardised processes, systems, and frameworks than when they are thrown in the environment of “improvise as we go”, which is inevitably the paradigm of service variation. Training materials can be easily aggregated into a knowledge library, further facilitating the onboarding process.

• It serves as the foundation for audience education and makes sales and marketing more efficient: A signature methodology is an endless trust-building tool. Boutique consultancies can create authoritative, education-driven pieces revolving around the pain points the methodology resolves, constantly driving demand for their services.

• It bolsters a consultancy’s value proposition: A signature methodology becomes a core part of its value proposition identity, representing its expertise, thought leadership, and commitment to delivering high-value solutions.

• It makes for easy recommendations: Deep expertise delivered through a signature methodology makes it easy for clients to offer referrals and recommendations. “Consultancy X helped our business achieve a 120% increase in Y with their Z approach” is a 'simple message' that can come with a signature methodology.

## Repetition – a bridge between expertise and a signature methodology

A signature methodology is only effective when it delivers outstanding results. In my experience, designing such a methodology without repetition is impossible.

By focusing on the same narrow list of problems for a highly targeted audience day in and day out, a consultancy achieves the following:

• Expertise clarity: The deeper the level of expertise, the more apparent it becomes how to solve foundational problems for clients.

• Optimisation of resources: Repeating similar projects over and over again results in the consultancy’s ability to narrow down its portfolio of resources that it needs to utilise for each project: everything from the onboarding emails it needs to send to what consultants assign the project to, to which software solutions to use for every step of the project.

• Data aggregation and streamlining: The only way to benefit from data insights is to standardise data aggregation and have enough relevant data to yield meaningful insights. Repetition of projects allows consultancies to streamline data aggregation to collect enough data to analyse it. Which tool delivers the best results? Which step in the process requires further refining? How many consulting hours are used to complete a project? Which consultant requires additional training to improve the quality of work or increase efficiency? The answers to these questions are hidden in the data.

• Pattern identification and recognition: Repetition of projects, combined with diligent data aggregation and analysis, will, over time, allow consultancies to spot patterns. It will give the consultancy a macro view of why specific pain points occur, what type of “treatment” is most effective in solving them, what impact these problems can have on the organisation, and so on.Pattern recognition differentiates experts from those with a superficial level of knowledge. It enables consultancies to diagnose prospects’ problems with incredible accuracy.

• Discovery of opportunities: The more a consultancy engages in repetition, the easier it is to develop vertical service extensions. Instead of creating entirely new services (meaning having to pitch a new audience and lacking sufficient depth to compete against firms specialised in these fields), consultancies with deep expertise can develop new and deeper components of already existing consulting services. Why? Because their deep knowledge and profound understanding of client problems due to repetition allow these consultancies to spot opportunities.

• Easy knowledge transfer: Repetition, focus, and deep expertise enable a consultancy to set up efficient knowledge transfer procedures. Whether it comes to internal recruiting and bringing new consultants up to the expected level of knowledge or helping clients build an in-house team, firms with repetitive processes and projects can transfer knowledge more effectively.

### Repetition vs “the hustle”

One of the most common traits I encounter in boutique consultancy owners and leaders is their “hustle mode”. It makes perfect sense, of course. Running a business means being responsible for bringing in revenue, recruiting top talent, doing quality control, and about a hundred other things. This “hustle” often fuels the very existence of a business.However, the “hustle mode” should be kept in check as it can come at odds with the commitment to repetition. It requires discipline and the ability to commit to a long-term vision. That’s why I urge boutique consultancy owners and leaders to be mindful of their entrepreneurial spirit – that eagerness to explore opportunities – and develop the discipline required to maintain focus.

### Repetition vs customisation

Repetition, by definition, leaves very little room for customisation. That, of course, doesn’t mean that boutique consultancies need to forget about customisation completely. Even applying a signature methodology will not be 100% the same for each client, no matter how narrow the client profile is. Typically, some minor tweaking and adjusting need to be done.However, I want to warn consultancy owners and leaders to be very careful about keeping the scope of customisation to a minimum If a project requires a high degree of customisation or is outside the immediate fo. In that case, I recommend that boutique consultancies ask themselves whether they would be justified in charging at least 50% more – whether the client would agree.

Why? Because a consultancy won’t have the advantages of the signature methodology and repetitions, those efficiency gains must be compensated.

> "A narrow expertise focus in a boutique consultancy may initially be tedious but, through repetition, becomes more exciting over time. People start inviting the consultancy—the experts, the industry leaders who know (almost) everything, have the most compelling data and trend analysis, can spot intriguing patterns, explain fascinating methodologies and solutions, reduce the variability of outcomes, get admired for thought-provoking ideas, and ultimately don't need to sell or convince anymore." (quote from Luk in a Linkedin post)

(quote from Luk in a Linkedin post)

## Case study: Winning with a Signature Methodology

A large pharmaceutical company invited me to help them assess pitches by consultancies for a post-merger digital transformation project – a 3-year contract valued at around €3 million.In brief:

• 14 consultancies submitted a proposal at the initial stage (RFP)

• 4 consultancies were invited to pitch (12-person evaluation committee)

• The final decision came down to picking between two consultancies:A Big-4 firmA boutique consultancy of 120 consultants that quoted €180K more than the Big 4 firm. Despite being €180k more expensive than boutique consultancy, it got the project.

• A Big-4 firm

• A boutique consultancy of 120 consultants that quoted €180K more than the Big 4 firm. Despite being €180k more expensive than boutique consultancy, it got the project.

At first sight, it may seem counterintuitive. The pharmaceutical company had a proposal from the Big 4 consulting firm that was much more suited to their budget, and they could tap into the massive pool of consultants they offered.In the exceptional pitch delivered by the boutique consultancy, the core strength lay in their 'signature methodology', which was developed and refined through repeated application over several years.

Their approach, tailored to address specific post-merger digital integration challenges, was presented with remarkable transparency during the pitch. The consultancy openly shared its journey of repetition, detailing the iterative process of perfecting its 'signature methodology' through past mistakes and lessons learned.

This candid presentation demonstrated their deep expertise and instilled high trust and confidence in the client. The impact was profound—despite a higher-cost proposal, the client was compelled to choose the boutique firm, valuing the predictable, outcome-driven results promised by their proven, repeatedly tested approach.

This pitch - see the recommended reading link to the case study below this paragraph - exemplifies the transformative power of repetition to develop a signature methodology to distinguish a boutique consultancy in a competitive market.

## In conclusion, a high-performance consultancy hinges on the unwavering commitment to focus and repetition.

The ability to design a signature methodology is paramount for boutique consultancies aiming to thrive in a competitive landscape. This distinctive approach, honed through repetitive application, offers numerous advantages ranging from enhanced differentiation and standardised processes to increased profitability and client satisfaction.By committing to repetition, boutique consultancies can refine and deepen their expertise, optimise resources, streamline operations, and unlock valuable insights from data that drive sustainable growth.While the allure of service variation is strong, everything that I’ve observed in my work with both struggling consultancies and high-performance consultancies points to the conclusion that it is the disciplined dedication to repetition that ultimately paves the path towards building a reputation for delivering outstanding results for clients, which is, ultimately, what clients want to pay for.Repetition and focus are not merely a means to an end but the cornerstone upon which high-performance consultancies are built.

# 9 Ways to Assess a Boutique Consultancy’s Expertise Reputation

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 03 September 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/9-ways-to-assess-a-boutique-consultancys-expertise-reputation

---

“You should go see this guy. He is the best!” How many times have we all heard something like this from our family and friends when looking for recommendations—be it for a medical specialist, a mechanic, a kid's tutor, or dozens of other people we needed specialised assistance from for a particular need?After hearing the name, we would often do a quick Google search, check out the reviews from past customers/patients/clients, and be reassured thatthis guyis indeedthe best!This is the power of expertise reputation, and it’s not very different in the B2B world. I urge boutique consultancies to make it a goal to bethe bestwhen it comes to resolving particular challenges.

## Why expertise reputation matters

I always say that consulting is a credence business. Consultancies sell their ability to resolve problems for their clients. They can fix those problems due to their expertise – the type of expertise that clients do not have internally.Getting a buy-in from a prospect requires creating trust-based relationships with that prospect. Consulting service buyers want to achieve maximum value with minimal risks.Many boutique consultancies fail to account for the relationship-building process between them, and prospects often start long before the first call, email, or meeting. It begins when prospects decide to take action on a specific need or challenge.They start Googling their questions, looking up consultancies, reading their websites and case studies, going back to their old emails to find a newsletter from that one consultancy that might be the right fit, asking their internal and external networks for recommendations, and so on.Consultancies that instantly get a head start in this process are the ones that are highly visible for their expertise reputation. Prospects keep coming across these consultancies’ names: their thought leadership pieces and results-driven case studies, referrals from team members and old colleagues, insightful LinkedIn posts, etc.Expertise reputation is the most powerful weapon in a boutique consultancy’s arsenal!

## Assessing expertise reputation: The checklist

So, how can a consultancy assess its level of expertise reputation and, as a result, its business development potential? Over the years, I’ve developed a checklist to help understand whether the reputation hinders or facilitates the consultancy’s success.1. How do consulting leaders and their teams feel when pitching the consultancy’s expertise?Are they confident in what they say and how their message comes across? Is it easy for them to explain the value that the consultancy can provide to clients?Strong expertise reputation is built on the ability to deliver high-value results. This ability is generally developed through the process of repetition: completing the same types of projects for the same kinds of clients in a similar context. Over time, this allows consultancies to crystallise their offering to clients: what they do, how they do it, what results they can confidently predict, what it would entail, and what the first step is to getting started.As a result, leaders and team members in such consultancies feel confident in their offering when pitching a prospect. They are clear, concise, and systematic.Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy2. Do prospects see the consultancy as a vendor or as an expert when it pitches its services?There are two different types of consultancies—strategic advisors and order takers. Of course, these are the two ends of a spectrum, and for many consultancies, it’s not quite as black and white.

However, I invite boutique consultancy owners to reflect on their past client work. What are those projects and interactions like? Is it primarily based on the tasks that a client asks the consultancy to complete, or is it the consultancy offering clients high-level advice on strategy, implementation, next steps, etc?If prospects go into the meeting telling a consultancy what they expect consultants to do, they most likely see the consultancy in an order-taking capacity. If, on the other hand, they come seeking advice, they have a certain level of trust in the consultancy's expertise and ability to resolve important pain points.3. Is preparing a proposal targeted and effortless or a significant investment?How many hours/days/weeks does the team spend preparing proposals?I found that the more time and resources a boutique consultancy needs to invest in preparing a proposal, the more desperate it becomes to chase prospects for a positive response.In-demand experts, on the other hand, have easy-to-explain proposals (read: value propositions) and don’t chase. Because their deep expertise is built on countless similar projects completed in the past, it takes minimal changes to a template proposal before it’s ready to be sent to a prospect. They take great advantage of standardisation and process optimisation that comes with repetition.4. Does the consultancy have a meaningfully different point of view, and do prospects connect to it?Boutique consultancies with a strong expertise reputation don’t need some vague consulting BS that hundreds of others in the market are producing. There is no “we build innovative solutions at the intersection of digital transformation and human creativity” type of meaningless messaging in their communication.Consultancies with deep expertise and a strong reputation can accurately diagnose problems and propose targeted solutions that will deliver concrete results. They don’t need to impress prospects with big words.Recommended reading:Dump the Buzzwords: What Actually Persuades Clients to Hire a Boutique Consultancy5. Is the consultancy able to charge premium fees?Boutique consultancies with a strong expertise reputation can confidently charge more than the market average. They don’t have to compete on pricing, pitching with unattractive rates or discounts to win projects.

“We don’t have the budget” is not a typical objection that high-performance boutique consultancies have to deal with. Prospects come to them because they believe in these consultancies’ ability to resolve critical problems. Prospects are willing to pay premium fees because of the high-value outcomes they expect to receive.6. What is the consultancy protecting when pitching: its short-term income or long-term expertise reputation?Protecting short-term income first means a consultancy will take on almost any project. Protecting expertise reputation is about taking on suitable projects or clients.I am certainly not arguing against the importance of short-term income. Without short-term income, there is no long-term income. However, I do urge boutique consultancies to strive to develop a system where financial stability is based on continuous work with long-term clients while growth is based on new client work. This ensures the consultancy doesn’t find itself desperately taking on projects outside its defined ideal client or zone of expertise, focusing instead on winning the perfect clients and projects.7. Who does the consultancy deal with during the project?Consultancies perceived by clients as order takers tend to be cc'd on hundreds of emails from low—and middle management. The client’s team scrutinises every detail, and every process move requires approval.Consultancies in a strategic advisory position, on the other hand, tend to work directly with senior executives. They don’t need to follow up with endless contacts. Instead, they offer recommendations, and it is then up to the client to put things in motion by assigning tasks to relevant teams.Prospects often classify consultancies with a weak expertise reputation as order takers because they haven’t built sufficient trust in their ability to resolve high-value problems in collaboration with C-level executives.8. Do clients respect the consultancy’s payment terms, or does the consultancy have to chase the client’s assistants for delayed payments?A healthy cash flow is as vital to a business’s success as a healthy blood flow to a human’s body. Any interruptions – especially avoidable interruptions related to delayed payments – put unnecessary stress on boutique consultancy owners and leaders.Unfortunately, this is a common problem for consultancies seen as order takers – the ones with a weak expertise reputation. They debate with lower-level team members at clients’ companies over the ‘hours worked’ instead of ‘outcomes achieved’. Invoices don’t get prioritised.This rarely happens to advisory types of consultancies, on the other hand. First of all, they almost never bill for hourly work. Their contribution is measured in the overall outcome, not based on the hours spent completing each individual task. Their invoices are unlikely to get lost in the shuffle because the client most likely would like to maintain a long-term relationship with the consultancy.9. Does the consultancy constantly overservice and undercharge clients?This is a common trap that I see many struggling boutique consultancies fall into. In an attempt to win and keep a client, they continue to expand the boundaries of their support and project scope. They have the nagging feeling that if they don’t give in to every client request, they will lose this client.This willingness to “go the extra mile” without adjusted remuneration usually comes from a place of insecurity—insecurity in one's expertise and the value it delivers, insecurity over the business's financial health, and insecurity in one's ability to win another project, a better-paying project.A strong expertise reputation, on the other hand, significantly reduces those fears. It enables boutique consultancy owners and leaders to establish and ‘enforce’ strict work parameters.Recommended reading:The Two Most Visible Indicators of a High-Performing Boutique Consultancy

## In Conclusion

Cultivating a robust expertise reputation is essential for boutique consultancies aiming to thrive in a competitive market.

As outlined in the checklist, a strong expertise reputation influences nearly every aspect of a consultancy's performance, from how confidently it pitches its services to the level of trust and autonomy it receives from clients.Ultimately, the path to building a strong expertise reputation lies in consistency and clarity – consistently delivering high-value results in a well-defined expertise domain and clearly communicating this value to prospects and clients.By focusing on long-term reputation over short-term gains, boutique consultancies can transform from vendors into trusted partners, ensuring sustained success and growth.

# Why Every Boutique Consultancy Needs a Well-Defined Signature Methodology

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 16 August 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-every-boutique-consultancy-needs-a-well-defined-signature-methodology

---

“What is your signature methodology?” I pose this question often in my calls with prospects and in my work with boutique consultancy clients.In most cases, I get a fast and straightforward answer fromhigh-performing consultancies. It’s usually something like, “We do X by utilising Y, which helps us deliver Z outcomes to our clients.”How are they so prepared to answer this question? Because the signature methodology is one of the critical components of their success. It’s a core element of their value proposition and one of their most significant selling points.On the other end of the spectrum are boutique consultancies that are struggling: the ones where consulting leaders and owners are overwhelmed, where team members are either overworked or underutilised, where growth is unsustainable or non-existent, where profit margins are far below industry standards.It comes as no surprise that I get very different answers in such conversations. Either there is no signature methodology, or the one in place is not strong enough to acquire and retain new clients.While I have discussed signature methodologies on multiple occasions, I’ve always considered it one of the foundational elements of success in a boutique consulting business. However, this foundational element deserves its own article.

So in this article, I’ll explore what a signature methodology is, why it is crucial for boutique consultancies to develop one, and how they can go about doing so.All of this is based on my experiences and hundreds of conversations, assessments, and discoveries I’ve conducted over the years.

## What is a signature methodology?

A signature methodology (SM) is a unique and proprietary approach developed by a consultancy to solve specific problems or address particular challenges their clients face. This methodology encapsulates the consultancy's expertise, processes, and best practices distilled into a structured framework.Without a repeatable signature methodology, a consultancy tends to underperform.I know that it’s a bold statement. However, I am deeply convinced that boutique consultancies can only perform at the highest level with a crystal clear value proposition combined with a repeatable, signature methodology. That’s the reason why I spend much time with my clients developing these signature methodologies.The absence of a standardised approach leads to higher process variability and inconsistent, unpredictable outcomes. Clients today are seeking reliability and certainty more than ever before.Recommended reading:Defining The High-Performing Boutique ConsultancyHere’s why every boutique consultancy needs a well-defined SM and why I consider it ‘underperformance’ if these objectives aren’t met.

Here’s why every boutique consultancy needs a well-defined SM and why I consider it ‘underperformance’ if these objectives aren’t met.

• Consistency and quality: A signature methodology enables consultancies to ensure that every project is executed with the same process quality, minimising errors and maintaining high standards. This makes for happier clients, more robust retention rates, and more productive employees.

• Efficiency and scalability: It allows teams to work more efficiently, reducing time spent reinventing processes for each project, enabling better project margins, and allowing boutique consultancies to take on more clients without compromising quality.

• Credibility and trust: A signature methodology demonstrates to clients a boutique consultancy’s expertise and reliability. Clearly articulated processes and expected outcomes instil confidence in prospects and clients.

• Differentiation: High-performing consultancies use their signature methodology to distinguish themselves from competitors and win projects—often at higher fees due to their ability to guarantee high-impact results.

• Predictable outcomes: Since signature methodologies are based on standardised processes implemented repeatedly, consultancies can reduce process variability, leading to more predictable and reliable results over time.

• Data-driven insights: Repeatedly applying the same methodology allows boutique consultancies to capture data, which, in turn, allows methods and services to be continuously refined and improved.

• Compelling use cases: Signature methodologies enable boutique consultancies to produce predictable outcomes, allowing consulting firms to create appealing use cases that can inspire and educate prospects. This is an impactful way to showcase proven success stories and build trust with prospects.

• Creation of SOPs and training materials: A signature methodology facilitates the effective development of standard operating procedures and training materials for the onboarding and training new consultants.

Without these advantages, I am convinced a boutique consultancy is likely underperforming.Missing out on these critical aspects almost always leads to deteriorating performance, such as lower project margins, inconsistent quality, inefficiencies, and a lack of trust and differentiation in the market, leading to higher new client acquisition costs.

## Developing a signature methodology

To develop a signature methodology, boutique consultancies need first to determine:

• Their specific target audience

• The value or outcomes they strive to achieve for this audience

An SM’s strength is its ability to deliver consistent, high-value results across various client projects. The real key to success is the mindset of the consultancy owner, who must embrace the power of repetition. Repetition is not just a process—it's the essential bridge that deepens expertise and reinforces the effectiveness of a signature methodology.By focusing on the same narrow list of problems for a highly targeted audience day in and day out, a consultancy achieves expertise clarity, resource optimisation, data aggregation and streamlining, pattern identification and recognition, opportunity discovery, and easy knowledge transfer.In short, there’s no SM without an obsessive commitment to repetition.Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy

### The three components of a top-notch signature methodology

Based on my meticulous notes throughout client work, first-hand observations, and personal experience setting up my signature methodology, I recommend that boutique consultancies ensure the following three components are in place:

#### #1. Discovery service

As part of an SM, the discovery service is a standardised initial phase where the consultancy thoroughly assesses the client's current situation.This phase involves in-depth discussions, data collection, and analysis to comprehensively understand the client's needs.The primary purpose of the discovery service is to identify the root causes of the client's problems and to outline aroadmapfor addressing them.By investing time in this well-designed preliminary step, the consultancy can ensure that subsequent solutions are highly relevant and practical, setting the foundation for a successful engagement.Recommended reading:Every Consulting Firm Needs a Discovery Service

#### #2. Problem resolution and delivery

The second component of a signature methodology is problem resolution & delivery.This phase involves structurally designed and standardised processes to solve specific problems and achieve desired outcomes. It includes a delivery methodology with clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency and quality.A key watch-out: Many consultancies try to differentiate the delivery by claiming to always be "on time, on budget, on scope”, which are just table stakes. That’s what clientsalwaysexpect.

#### #3. Client development

The third component of an SM is client development. This phase involves ongoing support, follow-up, and adoption programs to ensure clients achieve sustained success.This structurally designed and standardised component should be introduced from the outset during the discovery service presentation, creating trust and illustrating the entire journey or program to the client.

## What is the case with multiple services in a consultancy?

So what happens when a boutique consultancy offers multiple services? Does it mean it needs multiple signature methodologies?Short answer: YesLonger answer: If services are within a specific overarching expertise and are interconnected/adjacent, creating each subsequent signature methodology will be significantly easier. Many of the processes and tools used will most likely be applicable with minor adjustments. However, if these services are diverse and disconnected, it will most likely require developing signature methodologies from scratch for each.I’d like to stress that developing and maintaining a signature methodology is not a quick or easy task. The effort of developing and maintaining signature methodologies for disconnected services is exponentially bigger. Therefore, I advise boutique consultancies to first fully reflect on the complexity of running a multiple-service (or diversified) consultancy.In my experience, a narrow focus is the winner of the signature methodology game!

## In conclusion

A well-defined signature methodology is more than a nice-to-have for boutique consultancies. It's an essential component for sustained success and growth. It provides a framework for consistency, efficiency, and scalability, which in turn leads to higher client satisfaction, more robust retention rates, and improved profitability.Without it, consultancies will likely struggle with inefficiencies, inconsistent outcomes, and an inability to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.Boutique consultancies prioritising and refining their signature methodology are better equipped to deliver consistent, high-impact results that drive their business forward.

# Why One-Stop-Shop Consultancies Are Bound to Be Low-Performing

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 23 July 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-one-stop-shop-consultancies-are-bound-to-be-low-performing

---

Not long ago, I had a lengthy chat with the owner of a one-stop-shop (OSS) boutique consultancy. This firm offers services ranging from bookkeeping and accounting to tax and financial advice, HR consultancy and payroll admin, digital transformation, and more.“Luk, we offer growing and medium-sized businesses the convenience of sorting out a large chunk of their business needs in one place” – that was the selling point.There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach. Who am I to say that such businesses have no right to exist? However, I have yet to come across a one-stop-shop consultancy (or full-service - FS) that comes even close to the profit margins that successful specialised firms can achieve.I’ve spoken to owners and leaders in multiple such firms in Europe and North America. What I find in abundance at boutique OSS or FS consultancies is stress, though.Almost every conversation, once we start discussing topics just slightly below the surface, reveals the enormous pressure and the burden of uncertainty that these consultancy owners carry on their shoulders:

• The inability to accurately forecast revenue and project pipeline consistently,

• The constant chasing of prospects to sell as much as possible of the service portfolio,

• The endless demands from clients, order-taker-like (with a tendency to overservicing and hourly billing),

• The tough employee hiring challenges to cover all the different expertise domains across the service portfolio,

• The constant service offerings switch and adaptations to satisfy the broad prospects’ expectations.

You name it, I’ve heard it!

In this article, I want to explore why the very design of OSS or FS consultancies prevents them from becoming high-performing and what can be done about it.

## How one-stop-shop boutique consultancies operate

I want to clarify that I’m referring toboutiqueconsultancies only in this post. I’m not talking about large multinational consultancies – the Big Fours of the world.That’s a completely different ball game where an OSS or FS model can flourish due to the sheer volume of resources these firms have.The consultancies I work with and talk to are between 20 and 125 consultants and/or deliver between €2 million and €30 million in annual revenue.An OSS consultancy offers clients a wide range of independent services, intending to meet all their needs within a single firm. The idea is to be a single point of contact for all consultancy needs, theoretically simplifying the client's life and ensuring cohesive, integrated solutions.There are three main reasons why I noticed consultancy owners gravitate toward this business setup:

• Differentiation: Many owners try to set their consultancies apart with a “there is nothing we can’t handle” approach.

• Convenience: A common view is that the OSS model will eliminate much of the hassle for clients since they can now sort out multiple—or all—of their needs in one place.

• Risk reduction: It is perceived as a business model that minimises risk—the more services a consultancy offers, the larger its target audience, and the more avenues for revenue it opens up.

Unfortunately, research and everyday experiences have taught me that OSS or FS often disappoints expectations.Here’s why an OSS model typically underperforms.

*Recommended reading:The 12 Characteristics of a High-Performing Boutique Consultancy*

### The problem with the one-stop-shop business model

The idea of offering diverse, independent services sounds great in theory but usually leads to underutilization and diminished value. More specifically:

• Dilution of expertise: One of the most significant issues with the OSS model is the dilution of expertise. While an OSS aims to cover all bases, it often results in superficial knowledge across many areas rather than deep expertise in a few.This expertise dilution is detrimental to both the client and the consultancy. Prospects are increasingly cautious buyers – this trend was only accelerated by the pandemic but was building up for a while before it. Clients seek consultants with profound knowledge and experience in specific areas to address their most pressing challenges. They are looking for truly transformational results that will impact their bottom line. When a consultancy spreads itself too thin, it risks delivering subpar service quality. And prospects know it.

• Underutilization of services: Clients rarely utilise all – or even most of – the services an OSS offers. They tend to hire an OSS consultancy to address a specific need, never even considering taking advantage of the complete list of services. And really, how often do we, as consumers, try every single item on the menu at a buffet restaurant?

• Operational inefficiencies: This underutilization of services leads to wasted resources, as maintaining a broad range of services requires a substantial investment in hiring and retaining diverse experts. This results in higher operational costs without corresponding revenue, which, in turn, leads to diminishing profits.Instead of benefiting from the efficiency gains that come with process repetition, automation, and standardisation of processes, OSS consultancies spread their resources paper-thin.Recommended reading:Why Repetition Is the Path to Becoming a High-Performance Consultancy

• Client confusion: An OSS model can sometimes overwhelm clients with too many options. Clients may struggle to understand how to best utilise the range of services offered, leading to unclear expectations and, ultimately, dissatisfaction.Straightforward service offerings that clearly show how certain problems will be tackled and what outcomes will be achieved are generally more attractive to clients than a convoluted, expansive menu of options.

> "When you hang out a “full service” shingle, you’re advertising your firm as the equivalent of a family doctor or a country lawyer. Just remember that this business strategy attracts mostly small, unsophisticated clients with limited budgets". (Tim Williams)

## How OSS boutique consultancies can revise their model to achieve higher profit margins

While my base advice to aspiring consultancy owners would be not to go down the OSS route to begin with, the reality is that I don’t work with early-stage firms. My clients—and consultancy owners that I speak to daily—run businesses that have been around for at least 4-5 years and have built up significant resources, be it the number of employees or annual revenue.So, the issue that I help these consultancies tackle is what to do next, how to transition the consultancy into a business model that would be more conducive to delivering high-profit margins and would remove a large chunk of the stress of running an OSS business.With that in mind, here is what I recommend that boutique consultancies stuck in the OSS model consider:

### 1. Reducing the number of services for more focus

Rather than spreading thin, I suggest consultancies concentrate on their core strengths. By narrowing focus, firms can deliver higher-quality services and become experts in specific areas. This approach enhances client trust and ensures more efficient resource allocation, addressing the utilisation challenge. Specialisation allows for deeper expertise, which can lead to better client outcomes and higher satisfaction.

### 2. Creating clear client journeys

Designing structured client journeys can significantly improve cross-service utilisation by guiding clients through a sequence of connected services based on their maturity or improvement process. This creates a more coherent OSS model.This approach helps clients see the value in utilising multiple services in a logical progression, which, in turn, can improve their engagement and satisfaction. A well-designed client journey ensures that clients are not overwhelmed but see a clear path to comprehensively addressing their challenges.

### 3. Designing and implementing vertically integrated services

Vertical integration involves creating seamless, interconnected services within a particular domain.For example, a firm with strong expertise in digital transformation might offer a suite of services that include strategy development, implementation, and ongoing support, all tightly aligned and supporting each other.This approach ensures that all services are interconnected and, as a result, provides clients with a holistic model. Vertical integration can enhance service quality and deliver a more consistent client experience.Recommended reading:Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies

### 4. Leveraging cross-functional teams

Cross-functional teams can gather experts from various services to collaborate on client projects. This approach can be more integrated, but it’s not easy.

## The holdings/portfolio companies OSS challenge

A common trend in the consulting landscape involves investors and buyers acquiring consulting firms to create a portfolio of specialised services. These portfolios are strategically formed to integrate various boutique consultancies that complement each other.

While not all of these portfolios are created with the one-stop-shop (OSS) approach in mind, those that are will face the typical challenges associated with the OSS concept. The primary objective of these OSS-similar portfolios is to offer clients a one-stop-shop experience similar to what large integrated consultancy firms provide. However, as described in my article, they must navigate the challenges of maintaining coherence and integration.

The projected benefits of these portfolios could include:

• Broad service offering: Clients have access to a wide range of specialised services under one umbrella, making it convenient and efficient for them.

• Cost reduction: Unified management of finance, marketing, and HR functions helps in reducing overhead costs, as these functions are centralised and streamlined across the portfolio.

• Potential synergies: The portfolio aims to create synergies by leveraging the strengths of each boutique firm, leading to cross-functional collaboration and integrated solutions for clients.

Having worked with several such syndicates—all with varying degrees of centralised management and resource planning—I noticed that they tend to experience the same problems as solo boutique consultancies with an OSS or FS business model.

• Integration of services: Creating synergies at the service level involves integrating the different expertise areas of each boutique firm. This is complex because:Varied cultures and processes: Each firm has its own culture, processes, and methodologies, making it difficult to standardise and integrate operations.Coordination and collaboration: Effective collaboration across firms requires robust communication channels and a willingness to work together, which can be hindered by competition or differing priorities.Differing expertise domains: Each firm specialises in different areas of expertise, making it challenging to align and synchronise their services into a cohesive offering.

• Consistency in quality: Maintaining consistent quality across diverse services is challenging:Quality control: Ensuring each firm adheres to the same standards of quality and service delivery can be difficult.Client expectations: Managing client expectations and delivering a seamless experience across different service areas requires meticulous coordination.

• Marketing and business development: Consulting marketing is fundamentally about building trust at scale, with its roots in educating the target audience. Given the vast differences in expertise domains within the portfolio, creating synergies in marketing efforts is nearly impossible:Unified messaging: Crafting a unified message that effectively represents each firm's diverse services and expertise is highly challenging.Audience education: Educating a target audience that spans multiple domains requires tailored content and strategies, which can dilute the overall marketing efforts.Trust-building: Building trust across different markets and services simultaneously can lead to fragmented and less effective business development initiatives.

• Varied cultures and processes: Each firm has its own culture, processes, and methodologies, making it difficult to standardise and integrate operations.

• Coordination and collaboration: Effective collaboration across firms requires robust communication channels and a willingness to work together, which can be hindered by competition or differing priorities.Differing expertise domains: Each firm specialises in different areas of expertise, making it challenging to align and synchronise their services into a cohesive offering.

• Quality control: Ensuring each firm adheres to the same standards of quality and service delivery can be difficult.

• Client expectations: Managing client expectations and delivering a seamless experience across different service areas requires meticulous coordination.

• Unified messaging: Crafting a unified message that effectively represents each firm's diverse services and expertise is highly challenging.

• Audience education: Educating a target audience that spans multiple domains requires tailored content and strategies, which can dilute the overall marketing efforts.

• Trust-building: Building trust across different markets and services simultaneously can lead to fragmented and less effective business development initiatives.

In my experience, the myth of "finding synergies" in these diverse portfolios often crumbles under scrutiny. In reality, forcing alignment among vastly different expertise domains and attempting to standardise marketing, quality, and operations across boutique consultancies is a Herculean task that rarely pays off.

My advice: Instead of chasing elusive synergies, focus on leveraging each firm's unique strengths and specialisations. This approach – together with cost savings at the headquarters level, such as finance or HR – will yield far more practical and impactful results.

## In conclusion

In my experience, the OSS or FS model in consulting often promises more than it can deliver. Despite aiming to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions, it frequently leads to inefficiencies, diluted expertise, and reduced profit margins.

However, boutique consultancies can take several approaches to overcome these challenges. Narrowing their focus, creating structured client journeys, implementing vertically integrated services, and leveraging cross-functional teams are strategies that can deliver better value to clients.

I advocate these methods based on my experiences in the field, but I am sure other solutions may also be effective depending on each consultancy's specific context.

# Moving Beyond One-Off Projects in a Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 25 June 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/moving-beyond-one-off-projects-in-boutique-consultancy

---

There is a wall that I see many boutique consultancies hit, and this wall is preventing their businesses from growing at a sustainable, organic pace.The wall I’m referring to is the inability – or, often, the lack of strategy and intentional efforts – to move clients past one-off projects into a value-driven long-term relationship.Based on my extensive work with both high-performing consultancies and struggling businesses, the ability to develop new clients into long-term engagements makes a world of difference.So that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article: what 'The Project Wall' is, why boutique consultancies seem to struggle with overcoming it, and why every consulting business should prioritise it.

## 'The Project Wall': why boutique consultancies struggle with it

An overwhelming majority of boutique consultancies I’ve spoken to or worked with in the last few years exhibited the same pattern of behaviour: constantly having to ‘hustle’ to win new business to keep the consultancy afloat.So much work, time, and mental health goes into this single task. It never comes as a surprise that consultancy owners and leaders feel burnt out after a few years. This constant uncertainty, financial instability, and dependency on recruiting new clients are stress-inducing!How do these consultancies end up in this vicious loop? Simple, really. Their services were never designed for long-term collaboration. Instead, the service portfolio is centred around delivering one-off value.They tend to focus on a few immediate problems they can resolve for clients and typically don’t have the expertise to provide the more profound value a long-term engagement would require.

## Why breaking through the project wall is imperative

Predictable, recurring revenue is the foundation of the financial stability of a consulting business. Growth without predictability and financial stability is simply not possible. And on the rare occasions when it is, it’s not sustainable in the long run.The only way to achieve such financial stability is by deriving a large percentage of the revenue from long-term clients.My regular readers know I’m a big advocate of the 70/30 revenue split. For those unfamiliar, here is a brief explanation.The 70/30 revenue split refers to the target I advise boutique consultancies to set, where 70% of their revenue is derived from work with existing clients and 30% is generated by new clients. This split puts revenue stability first, leaving plenty of room for business development.Existing clients fuel stability. New clients fuel growth.Recommended reading:How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting GrowthThe current system that I see so many consultancies operate in – one where 80%+ of revenue comes from new clients – is broken.Competition is fierce. Prospects have more options than ever. They are also significantly more independent in doing their research. The decision-making process has become more complex and involves more stakeholders than ever. The cost of client acquisition is too high.

> Relying on one-time projects is like running a race with ever-changing finish lines. Each completed project leads to another wall, another beginning, with no momentum or cumulative growth.

Relying on one-time projects is like running a race with ever-changing finish lines. Each completed project leads to another wall, another beginning, with no momentum or cumulative growth.

If a boutique consultancy cannot develop existing clients, it will always have an existential struggle.

Developing existing clients provides consultancies with the following:

• Stability: Revenue from existing clients is the lifeblood of any consultancy. It gives peace of mind and a steady cash flow. This stability helps leaders plan resources better, reducing revenue volatility and lowering the need for constant new client acquisition. With reliable income from existing clients, pipeline forecasting becomes more accurate.

• Expertise depth: Long-term client relationships push consultancies to deepen their expertise. Understanding a client's broader context, from industry trends to regulatory challenges, allows the consultancy to offer more valuable insights and solutions. The longer a firm works with a client, the more nuanced and comprehensive its understanding becomes.

• Cross-selling opportunities: Trust built over time opens doors for cross-selling. Firms can identify opportunities to offer additional services from different departments or new regions. This expansion increases revenue and strengthens client relationships.

• Social proof and referrals: Existing clients are invaluable for generating case studies and referrals. They can showcase the immediate and long-term impact of the consultancy's work, making it easier to attract new clients through proven results and word-of-mouth recommendations.

• Pilots and validation: Trusted clients are ideal for testing new services and methodologies. Before launching new offerings, firms can gather critical feedback from these clients, ensuring better-aligned services and more robust market positioning.

• Process standardisation: Repeated work for existing clients allows for process optimization. Identifying inefficiencies, improving methodologies, and forecasting needs become more straightforward. Standardised processes lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness, something more challenging to achieve with new clients.

• Lifecycle discovery: Long-term engagements reveal typical client journeys. Consultancies can track how their solutions are adopted across different departments and understand the broader impact on the client's organisation. This insight helps refine services and demonstrate value over time.

• Better profitability: Developing existing clients boosts profitability. Acquiring new clients is expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, existing clients already trust the consultancy, leading to lower BD costs. In my experience, long-term clients often have larger budgets for projects, and with established processes & knowledge, the consultancy can deliver services more efficiently. This reduces costs & increases margins.

## What jumping over the wall entails

Moving clients from a one-off project delivery to a long-term partnership is a multi-step process. It’s not just calling up current or past accounts and asking, “what else can we do for you, dear client?”The two most important steps of the process are 1) developing an inbound motion and 2) executing a deliberate service design strategy.

### 1. Developing an inbound motion

Inbound motion is about creating an inbound way of managing a consultancy's pipeline, forecasting the business reliably, and ensuring existential stability. Simply put, it’s about getting prospects to come to you instead of chasing them.Failing to set up and optimise inbound motion bears severe costs, including:

• Poor scalability: Consultancies forfeit the chance to attract multiple clients without increasing resources. In an era of labour shortage and high people costs, they end up missing out on non-linear growth (decoupling growth and hiring).

• Low-cost efficiency: Acquisition costs are much higher, while profits are significantly lower.

• Team stress: Constantly chasing, pitching, contracting, onboarding, delivering, and retaining clients creates enormous pressure, often creating retention issues.

• Poor client development: Overloading a team with all the above new client activities leaves no time to develop existing clients—a vicious cycle.

• Lower quality prospects: A consultancy misses out on pre-qualified prospects more likely to convert because they came to this consulting firm.

• More challenging client retention: Chased clients are non-ideal clients (often a source of frustration for everybody), making it harder to keep them engaged and loyal.

• Weak pricing leverage: Without a solid inbound motion, consultancies may be compelled to lower their fees to attract clients, leading to diminished profit margins.

• Talent attraction: Poor visibility means poor appeal to top consultants who might consider joining.

• Laser-sharp positioning: A consultancy's ability to clearly define its expertise domain and target audience is fundamental. Laser-sharp positioning ensures that the consultancy addresses the specific needs of its ideal clients.

• Attractive value proposition: An irresistible value proposition showcases what sets the consultancy apart and why clients should choose it over competitors. It communicates the unique benefits and solutions offered.

• Expertise-driven thought leadership: By openly sharing problem-resolution expertise consistently, actively engaging with the audience, and providing valuable insights, consultancies build credibility and trust.

• Frictionless buyer journeys: Streamlined, user-friendly buyer journeys make it easy for potential clients to engage with the consultancy. Simplicity is paramount.

### 2. Executing a deliberate strategy of service design

So, a consultancy sets up and optimises its inbound motion. Qualified prospects are entering the pipeline. Now what?

Now is the time to impress the prospects with the initial project delivery and encourage long-term collaboration. This is where strategic service design comes in.To design a portfolio of services that facilitate long-term relationships with clients, I advise boutique consultancies to consider these factors:

• Trust-building entry services: Offering entry or discovery services that are both appealing and confidence-building can lead to long-lasting client relationships. These services provide a glimpse into the consultancy's expertise.

• Repeatable, proven methodology: A well-defined and repeatable methodology with predictable outcomes is reassuring to clients. It showcases the consultancy's ability to deliver results consistently.

• Excellence in service delivery and impact: Proven by outcome-based client testimonials, service excellence is a testament to the consultancy's commitment to client success. These testimonials provide social proof and build trust.

• Value-driven recurring services: Shifting clients from one-off projects to recurring work requires developing services that can be delivered weekly/monthly/quarterly. This could be subscription-based access to proprietary data, advisory support, etc. It could also be vertical service integration, i.e., progressively deepening the consultancy's service offering, providing a spectrum of solutions that span from broad strategic advice to highly specialised, granular recurring interventions.

• Key account management: Consultancy leaders and consultants should be trained on best KAM practices. This involves regular client check-ins, consistently gathering information on their pain points, setting up KPIs on KAM performance or outcomes, etc. The primary KAM goal should continuously be deepening the relationship with a client and not mindlessly upselling them. It’s about discovering meaningful opportunities that will significantly impact the client’s business by gradually expanding and deepening the understanding of the client’s business, goals, industry concerns, etc.

Inone of my earlier articles, I provide a few examples of the most visible indicators of a high-performing consultancy, particularly those related to developing existing clients.

## Risks to avoid past the wall

There is no strategy in the world that is entirely free of risk. Fueling financial stability through existing client development is no exception.These are the risks that I want boutique consultancy owners to be aware of and design strategies to avoid:

• Shifting power dynamics: Consultancies risk losing power in sales due to revenue dependency on existing clients. Clients becoming too dominant in the relationship can lead to price erosion and scope creep.

• Pleaser syndrome: Firms with a large percentage of revenue generated by a limited number of clients often feel pressured to please these clients at all costs. This pressure can result in becoming order takers instead of trusted advisors, which negatively impacts pricing power and the consultancy’s perceived value.

• Erosion towards hourly billing: Over-reliance on existing clients can lead consultancies to transition into hourly work instead of value-driven project work. This shift means their contribution is measured by hours worked rather than the value delivered, resulting in the devaluation of their services and income.

• Growth limitations: While it’s possible to be successful with the 70-75% strategy, relying on this strategy as the primary source of growth or stability is unrealistic. Consultancy firms must remain proactive in adding new clients to the portfolio, or growth will stall in the long run.

To avoid these traps, I recommend that consultancies establish non-negotiable boundaries with the consultancy's clients. Unreasonable demands from clients should be pushed back against. Remembering that a consultancy's expertise is its value, not its availability to do endless small tasks, is essential.Moreover, being proactive in managing client relationships can help mitigate these risks. Regularly reviewing the client portfolio and ensuring it aligns with the consultancy's broader business goals is a valuable exercise.

## In conclusion

The project wall represents a significant barrier for boutique consultancies, hindering their ability to achieve sustainable growth and financial stability.Many consultancies fall into a cycle of constantly chasing new clients for one-off projects, leading to burnout, financial instability, and limited long-term success.To overcome this, consultancies must strategically shift their focus towards developing long-term client relationships, providing a stable revenue base, opportunities for more profound expertise, and enhanced profitability.Implementing inbound motion and designing services for long-term engagements are critical steps in this transformation.By attracting clients through precise positioning, compelling value propositions, and thought leadership, consultancies can reduce the stress and inefficiency of constant client acquisition.Additionally, offering trust-building entry services, establishing repeatable methodologies, and delivering value-driven recurring services help convert initial project successes into ongoing partnerships.Key account management practices further deepen client relationships, ensuring that consultancies maintain high service standards and continuously address client needs.

# 10 Lessons Boutique Consultancy Owners Can Take Away from My Newsletter Strategy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 14 May 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/10-lessons-boutique-consultancy-owners-can-take-away-from-my-newsletter-strategy

---

Email is the third-highest owned media platform B2B marketers use to distribute content,reports Content Marketing Institute.For those wondering, an organization’s website comes in the first place, and a company’s blog takes the second spot.Simply put, email marketing is still one of the most effective tools boutique consultancies have at their disposal.In this article, I’d like to share how my newsletter –The Authority– has been one of the drivers of the success of my consulting business, and what lessons I’ve learned along the way that boutique consultancy owners can apply in their business development strategy.Have a quick look at my newsletter.

## Newsletters – a central distribution hub of knowledge and trust-building

My approach to newsletters has been the same for decades. My first “newsletter” was just a simple email sent from my mailbox to a curated list of contacts on a regular basis.It included my case studies, articles, takeaways from events I presented at and attended as a delegate, and other resources. No email marketing software. No tracking open or click-through rates.Just a straightforward communication avenue to keep my contacts in the loop on the types of insights I thought they would find useful.I am extremely anti-spam. I’m against the idea of purchasing newsletter subscribers or somehow tricking people into subscribing to my newsletter. It’s really easy to subscribe to my newsletter and just as easy to unsubscribe.For me, a newsletter is the single most important channel to nurture relationships with those who showed interest in my expertise and in what I had to say. It’s a level of trust that I would never want to compromise.

While this is a macro view of my approach to newsletters and email marketing, I’ll now get in the nitty-gritty of how boutique consultancy owners can use email marketing as a powerful tool for business growth.

### #1. The quality of subscribers is more important than the quantity

I never cared how fast my email list grew. Of course, I keep track of the KPIs – who subscribed when and why, how they engage with my content, which pieces of content attract more subscribers, etc.But the speed of growth was never my concern or priority. While it's tempting for many businesses – boutique consultancies being no exception – to focus on growing their email list as fast as possible, having a large number of uninterested, irrelevant, or disengaged subscribers can be counterproductive.Instead, I recommend that boutique consultancies focus on the quality of their subscribers – more specifically, how neatly they fall in the parameters of a target audience.I strongly believe that it’s better to have an email list of 1,000 contacts who deeply engage with the consultancy’s content and convert to clients at a solid rate than to have 100,000 subscribers who are only somewhat relevant, if at all.

### #2. An email list is the ultimate trust weapon

I don’t gate my content. Anyone can go onmy blogand read the content I post with zero barriers. Similarly,my LinkedIn postsare there for anyone who comes across my profile.So why do people subscribe to my newsletter? For the most part, it’s for a simple reason really: to make sure they are regularly reminded to check my latest thought leadership. Why? Because they see value in it.For me, that’s the ultimate demonstration of trust – especially in this day and age where we are bombarded with marketing messages both offline and online.The fact that I’m entrusted with the email address to keep a subscriber in the loop on my latest blog articles, bite-sized advice on LinkedIn, and other forms of content is often one of the first measurable steps toward building a long-lasting relationship with that subscriber.It’s the job of consulting firms is to nurture and grow that trust by sharing their expertise and providing answers to prospects' questions, addressing their pain points, and, thus, showcasing their subject matter authority.At the end of the day, people do business with those they trust, so I recommend boutique consultancy owners to use their email list to nurture that trust.

### #3. An email list requires regular pruning to stay effective

“Luk, we have a database of 50,000+ people but our open rate is barely 5%!” That’s what one of my clients told me as I was gearing up to conduct an audit of their business strategy.Now, 50,000, “WOW! That’s an impressive number, especially for a boutique consultancy”, right? Well, that wasn’t the case for this consultancy.While the mailing list was indeed more than 50K contacts, even a quick scan showed just how poor-quality the list was. At least a third of the contacts contained no data points beyond the email address. About a quarter of the contacts appeared to be bot subscribers. Thousands of contacts haven’t opened the consultancy’s newsletter in over 6 months.That’s why I regularly prune my contacts. It keeps my mailing list fresh and relevant. That means my open rates are high – 40-50%, with theindustry averageat 29.61%.Pruning not only improves open and click-through rates, but it also reduces costs associated with email marketing platforms that charge based on the number of subscribers.

### #4. A newsletter is an educational channel first, a business development channel second

The primary goal of my newsletter is to educate and provide value to my subscribers. While I have a section on my services, it is at the very end of my newsletter and is not promoted in any way.My philosophy has always been that clients will come only after I provide them with sufficient value and build trust based on the educational content that shows my understanding of their needs. This approach has served me well over the years. I get call requests by prospects on a daily basis.I recommend boutique consultancy owners and leaders to not think of newsletters as “something that marketing teams need to handle.” Instead, it’s a communication channel that they should actively get involved in.

*Recommended reading:5 Reasons Consulting Leaders Are Missing the Digital Train*

### #5. A newsletter should connect to the larger audience education mechanism

My newsletter doesn't exist in a vacuum. It’s part of my broader strategy to educate and engage my audience. LinkedIn is one other such component. This is where I regularly share advice and insights with my network.Every time I publish an issue of the newsletter, I share it with my network on LinkedIn. As a result, about 75% of my subscribers come from that source. 10% come from my subscription CTA on the website, and about 10% from the subscription link in the newsletter itself.What boutique consultancy leaders can take away from this is that it’s important to connect a newsletter to other platforms – the website, blog, social media, webinars, etc. They can cross-share their content across these channels to create a cohesive narrative and increase their reach.

### #6. Consistency and setting expectations are key

I send my newsletter every other Wednesday (with a few exceptions here and there due to public holidays, holiday seasons, etc.). I have the same sub-sections in the newsletter every time. My subscribers have come to expect certain types of content from me and to have my newsletter land in their inbox on certain days.Of course,my newsletterhas evolved and changed over time. I refined the design elements, I experimented with different sections, etc. But 99% of what my subscribers receive has been consistent.Why does it matter? Because it allows me to build certain habits with my subscribers. Becoming a part of their routine is a massive achievement. It’s a sign that I’ve become a go-to source for a certain type of educational content and my subscribers actively make the time in their very busy schedules to catch up with what I’ve shared in the past two weeks.Boutique consultancy owners can benefit tremendously from becoming a part of their target audience’s routine. And in order to do so, they need to set the right expectations with their newsletter and make sure to deliver on those expectations at regular frequencies.

### #7. A newsletter is an excellent tool for engaging past clients and continuing to deliver value

A newsletter is a great way to maintain relationships with past clients by providing ongoing value.By sharing success stories, updates about the consultancy, or industry developments relevant to them, boutique consultancies can stay top of mind with past clients. This continued engagement can lead to repeat business, referrals, and an expanded network.

By keeping past clients in the loop, boutique consultancies maintain their position as a trusted resource.Recommended reading:Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting Business

### #8. A newsletter is a massive source of relevant website traffic

A third of my blog traffic comes from the newsletter, and these users stay on average >3 minutes on my blog. This has been the case for more than two years now.These are my most loyal readers. And what’s more, new clients almost always refer to my newsletter as a loyal reader.What I also want boutique consultancy owners and leaders to consider is that this influx of traffic can improve their website's search engine ranking, especially if newsletters are published on the site.

### #9. A strategically utilized email list is a cost-effective way of staying top of mind with prospects

It happens often – someone who subscribed to my newsletter 2-3 years ago decides to book my services. Clearly, they were familiar with my content, my expertise depth, and my services. However, the time was not right.By regularly staying in touch via my newsletter and continuing to provide value, I am able to remain top of mind with these prospects.The reality is that nurturing contacts is not a race. It’s a marathon. Sure, most of my clients do not take years to convert. However, nurturing my contacts is one of the reasons I don’t ever stress out about my pipeline of new business. In fact, I get increasingly picky in order to protect my time.

### #10. Newsletter and email list KPIs provide valuables insights

Key performance indicators such as open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and unsubscribe rates offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of email marketing efforts. I have had so many boutique consultancy owners and leaders report struggling to measure the impact of their thought leadership efforts over the years.Well, newsletters make the process very straightforward. If configured correctly, any email marketing software will show a wide range of data: who subscribed when and where, who opened which email and clicked on what links, at what time of day/week subscribers engage the most/least, where the subscribers are located, and so on.This data, in combination with other content- and website-related KPIs that I strongly encourage boutique consultancies to track and assess, provides insights into how well marketing and business development efforts are working, as well as what adjustments could further improve the ROI.

## In conclusion

Newsletter-based email business development is a powerful tool for boutique consultancy owners looking to grow their business, engage with prospects, former and existing clients, and build a trusted brand.As illustrated by my experience with "The Authority," newsletters can serve as a central hub for distributing valuable content and nurturing relationships.Just like with my approach to thought leadership, I urge boutique consultancy owners to think of newsletters as an audience education opportunity first and foremost. Because the business will follow!

# The 12 Characteristics of a High-Performing Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 19 March 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/characteristics-of-high-performing-boutique-consultancy

---

In my work as a performance advisor to boutique consultancies, I have the pleasure of working with and learning from both consultancies that are struggling and those that are outperforming their competitors by, e.g. above-market growth or insane margins.Over the years, I’ve audited the performance of almost 100 consultancies. I’ve spoken to hundreds of consultancy owners and leaders. Over time, specific patterns began to appear. I discovered that the success or failure of a consultancy is almost always determined by how they go about a number of foundational elements such as positioning, value proposition, service and client journey design, standardisation of processes (SOPs), client development, thought leadership, inbound new client attraction, etc.There are numerous similarities in the foundational mistakes that struggling consultancies make and, similarly, how well the high-performing consultancies deliver on the same foundational elements.

## Measuring success in consulting beyond the P&L

When I ask consultancy owners or partners about the firm’s performance, they almost always refer to the most recent P&L statement. It's the go-to document for most of them when assessing the consultancy's health and prosperity.However, while necessary and valuable, this traditional financial perspective is just one piece of the puzzle—a snapshot of past financial performance that unfortunately falls short of capturing the complexity of a consultancy's true success.Why? The P&L document contains lagging indicators, rendering it less effective for immediate course correction or proactive decision-making. More crucially, it must encompass the critical consulting-specific aspects that define consultancy excellence.To truly know and understand the characteristics of success, we must look beyond conventional financial metrics and start measuring the consultancy's performance in the areas that truly define it. These consultancy-specific KPIs provide a window into the firm's inner workings, shedding light on how well it gets managed and where improvements can be made.

## Characteristics that high-performing boutique consultancies have in common

My insights are drawn from hands-on experiences rather than scientific research. I continually update this collection based on the latest developments, observations from my work over the past year, and real-world experiences.These insights encompass best practices, financial performance benchmarks, growth achievements, client testimonials, business development successes, and other critical aspects that define successful boutique consultancies. They are theoretical concepts and practical, experience-based strategies that have proven effective, even in the context of the challenging 2023 for many boutique consultancies.Here you go. I hope you can harness these updated insights to propel your consultancy to new heights of success.

### 1. Crystal-clear positioning

Successful boutique consultancies excel in identifying and targeting a specific audience, effectively addressing their unique pain points with expert-led methodologies. They are crystal clear about it publicly: on their website, social media, etc.Suggested KPIs:

• 90% Relevant leads attraction with easy qualification

• Few irrelevant inquiries (set target)

• Short business development cycle (set time target)

### 2. Differentiating thought leadership and client education

Leading boutique consultancies distinguish themselves by offering bold, inspiring, research-based and data-driven perspectives, establishing themselves as educators in their respective fields.Suggested KPIs:

• Substantial content attribution to revenue (self-reported attribution, set target)

• 80-90% inbound lead generation motion (versus outbound ‘chasing’)

• 90% (or higher) inbound from ICP (because that’s clear from the TL content)

### 3. Focused expertise with proven outcomes

Elite consultancies distinguish themselves through their deep, specialised expertise, clearly communicated via a unique, outcome-based value proposition, commanding premium pricing and earning unmistakable client trust. The approachSuggested KPIs:

• Value Proposition clarity score (client research, set target)

• 70-80% Proposal win rates

• Availability of outcome-based client testimonials (and sharing via thought leadership such as interviews, podcasts, case studies)

• The power to set premium rates (set target, 1,5x, 2x or 3x market average?)

• Above market margins >50% (‘power in the sale’, set target)

*Recommended reading:(Case Study) How a Boutique Consultancy Beat a Big 4 Consulting Firm*

### 4. Aligned co-owners

Successful co-owners in boutique consultancies demonstrate unity in their vision and agenda for growth and business strategy, driving the company forward cohesively.Suggested KPI:

• Quarterly internal alignment score (self-reported by owners and employees, set target)

### 5. Inbound client acquisition

Leading boutique consultancies excel in consistently attracting new clients at a reduced cost through sophisticated marketing tactics and robust networking strategies. Their inbound approach enables them to surpass the traditional chase for clients, establishing a steady and cost-effective client inflow (I call it ‘the destination consultancy’).

Suggested KPIs:

• 30% Inbound-based, new client revenue (annually)

• Cost of acquisition (CAC) <10% and declining over time (because of growing inbound motion)

• Win rates >70%

• Fast contract closing: set target (<4 weeks?)

• Higher average contract volume: set target, monitor progression

### 6. Robust client development and retention

Including a key account approach at the senior client level, these consultancies excel in methodically expanding services for existing clients, ensuring high satisfaction levels and long-term retention.Suggested KPIs:

• 70% Existing client-based revenue (high Client Lifetime Value)

• 90% Client retention (meaning: high client satisfaction score)

• Client concentration risks: top 3 <25-30% of total revenue

• High Lifetime Value: set target

• Revenue per FTE improvement over time: set target (non-linear growth), monitor progression

• Revenue reliability (stability through high retention & LTV): set target - see pipeline topic

*Recommended reading:The 4 I’s of Service Design for Boutique Consultancies*

### 7. Agile operating model and non-linear scaling

Successful boutique consultancies achieve growth by focusing on non-linear scaling, where revenue increases without the proportional addition of new consultants. This is facilitated by implementing an agile operating model characterised by process standardisation and productisation alongside innovative service offerings and delivery methods. Such an approach allows consultancies to scale operations efficiently and effectively while remaining responsive to changing market dynamics.Suggested KPIs:

• % Revenue from standardised service(s): set target, monitor progression

• Revenue per FTE >150k (depends on the type of consultancy, set correct target)

• Increasing Revenue per FTE, meaning:growing sales capabilities of the entire consulting team (over time)utilisation in control (targets depending on consulting activity and job/role)SOPs in place to improve productivity (standardisation & productisation)scope management in control (weekly project reviews, internally agreed exceptions are possible for commercial or outcome protection reasons)

• growing sales capabilities of the entire consulting team (over time)

• utilisation in control (targets depending on consulting activity and job/role)

• SOPs in place to improve productivity (standardisation & productisation)

• scope management in control (weekly project reviews, internally agreed exceptions are possible for commercial or outcome protection reasons)

### 8. Revenue reliability and precision in pipeline management

Top boutique consultancies excel in managing their new opportunity pipeline with precision. They focus on detailed monitoring and accurate forecasting, providing crucial inputs for project planning, resource allocation, and financial control. This disciplined approach to pipeline management allows them to anticipate future needs and adapt effectively, ensuring operational efficiency and stability.Suggested KPIs:

• Pipeline forecast reliability: 100% next month, 80% +2 months, 50-60% +3 months, 30-40% +4 months (higher percentages should be the ambition), monitor progression

### 9. Robust infrastructure

Successful boutique consultancies invest in a robust infrastructure focused on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and PSA (Professional Service Automation) systems. These tools are pivotal for efficient project and resource management, managing client relationships and streamlined project delivery.Suggested KPI:

• CRM & PSA in place and driver of business development, project and resource planning, project operations/delivery, weekly pipeline reviews, and client management

### 10. Disciplined consultancy performance management (the ‘classical financials’ at the fingertips)

Leading boutique consultancies excel in effective performance management by meticulously tracking two categories: 1) financial parameters like revenue, margins, and cash flow, and 2) consulting-specific metrics such as utilisation, win rates, project metrics, client satisfaction scores, etc. (see consulting-specific metrics in this article). This dual focus thoroughly evaluates the overall business health and operational efficiency.Suggested KPIs:

• Revenue, revenue trend, revenue forecast reliability score (set target), revenue detail per project/client/service

• Gross margin >50%, GM trend, GM per project/client/service

• Cash flow management (min. 3-4 months payroll coverage, set working capital target)

• Net profit target 20% (the result of 50% GM, 20% overhead, 10% CAC)

### 11. Exceptional client service and project delivery

Outstanding boutique consultancies set themselves apart through unparalleled client service and delivery excellence. They prioritise understanding and meeting clients' needs, ensuring every interaction and deliverable exceeds expectations. This commitment to quality service results in strong, lasting client relationships, fostering loyalty and often leading to repeat business and referrals.Suggested KPIs:

• CSAT, Client Satisfaction score (via interview - post-project, avoid cold NPS, set ambitious target), monitor progression

• 90% Client retention (see above, we already have this in #6)

• 95% Project budget & timeline adherence: on time, on spec, on budget

• 95% Project outcomes success rate: project goals achieved (to be evaluated in CSAT)

### 12. Talent attraction and retention

Elite boutique consultancies excel in retaining key team members and attracting top talent. They create an engaging work environment that fosters commitment and motivation, offering growth opportunities, competitive comp & ben, and a culture that values collaboration, client service, focus and deep expertise.Suggested KPIs:

• Employee satisfaction score (check quarterly, set ambitious target)

• Key player retention (key roles to be defined, set ambitious target)

• Short time-to-hire (to be defined, set ambitious target)

## In conclusion

2023 was a challenging year for most consultancies that I spoke to. We had two years of almost unlimited post-pandemic growth in consulting – in 2021 and 2022. I consider these two years to be ‘outlier years’ as they were not exactly a regular revenue growth continuation from 2018-2019.However, since late 2022, the consulting business has been facing economic uncertainty – brought about by fluctuations in the global economy, geopolitical tensions, and cost inflation (to name a few).I’ve talked to many consultancy owners who reported feeling stressed and overwhelmed by the pressure to keep their businesses afloat or maintain their growth projections.On the other hand, high-performing consultancies felt significantly more optimistic in our conversations. Their deep subject expertise and the value that they deliver to their clients made them confident in their ability to sustain their growth.As we close quarter one of 2024, it is with this resilience, expertise, and unwavering commitment to excellence that consultancies can rise to meet the evolving landscape and seize new opportunities for growth and success.To truly measure their success, consultancy owners are encouraged to employ the consultancy-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) discussed in this article, which - in my experience - can provide invaluable insights into their performance across the 12 critical consultancy success characteristics.

# Consultancies Can't Grow Their Business When Their Websites Suck

This article was last updated on 10 March 2024.

Consultancy websites is a popular topic of discussing in my work with consulting firms and their leaders. I receive 2-3 questions about it every week. So I thought I'd compile and share a list of some of the patterns I've noticed when reviewing boutique consultancies' websites. Fasten your seatbelts.

## Most consultancies' websites suck

Yes, they suck. Big time. Sorry to say. I am struggling with such poor professionalism. And to be honest, most boutique consultancies are underestimating the criticalness of a website to succeed. What do consulting leaders think buyers of consultancy services do when evaluating candidate firms (or their consultants)?Exactly, they check out the consultancy and its consultants/advisors. And hopefully, the consultancy's website shows an abundance of expert evidence. Without easy-to-find social proof and immediate evidence of profound knowledge, the risk-averse and impatient buyer will skip to the digitally savvy competitor. No mercy.

> If your website isn’t your most effective source of pipeline & revenue, then something is wrong. (Chris Walker, B2B Marketing Expert and CEO at Refine Labs)

Consulting is a competitive, trust-based business. Boutique consultancies need to have darn good websites with a proper structure, unparalleled proof of expertise, and influential educational content. And most of all, these websites should organically generate demand for the firms' (focused and publicly announced) expertise.

Here's what I see in, say, 97% of the cases when I evaluate boutique consultancies and their websites. I see ‘the old', and firms should get rid of it quickly.

## ‘The Old School' consultancy websites

#### These websites are self-centered, with a pure inside view, looking like the big 'we-we-we' show.

Here are just a few of the things that 'the old' websites have in common:

• The 'We-Show':Almost all of them say: ‘Here’s what WE do…’ (this is the inside view or the we-view; the outside view would be: ‘here’s what clients say we were able to achieve for them’). I urge consultancies to get rid of the ‘what WE DO’ forever, and lead with outcomes and expertise.

• Here’s what WE do: They immediately start with a laundry list of services (impossible to have all that deep expertise - and educate about it, by the way);

• Not updated:The last update of the website was 2 years ago, 2 out of the 10 (!) services show 404 broken links (I am not exaggerating, I see this every week);

• Bad security:These websites are still in HTTP (instead of HTTPS), totally unsecured. Boutique consultancies need to wake up and get on board with the bare minimum of cyber security practices!

• Unclear audience:It’s unclear who these websites are talking to. Who is the buyer? What type of client in what industry will benefit from the expertise of the consultancy? There’s no information about their point of view, approach, methodology, or process used;

• The vision:They love to brag about their (copied from other websites) bold vision: “We are passionate, result-oriented, team-focused, innovative, unique, 20 years of collective experience…”, blah blah blah;

• The references:Here’s how they look: “They are nice consultants, easy to work with” (heck, maybe consultancies could try to get a reference explaining they love giving discounts);

• The about:Another inside-driven self-love section, no attractive information about this history of the expertise, nothing related to real achievements in the context of the prototypical problem of the target audience (because there’s no target audience);

• The blog:the last blog post is from 8 months ago. There are maybe 10 articles in total. No CTAs to subscribe. No depth to the content. Just an abandoned junk yard;

• The contact form:This is really old school (as the one and the only way to get in touch), and I guess the follow up happens after 6 days, if at all;

• Poor traffic:I always check out the traffic to these websites: close to zero, a sad story;

• And when I ask Google:The tremendous unknown boutique consultancy, on search page 27 for the most relevant keywords I can come up with based on their website.

## ‘The New School' consultancy websites

As David C. Baker puts it from the perspective of the client:

> Will I see myself uniquely in your web presence? Will it eerily feel like you have a camera in my office? Will it be obvious that you've worked for many other companies just like mine who have unique needs? (David C. Baker)

Will I see myself uniquely in your web presence? Will it eerily feel like you have a camera in my office? Will it be obvious that you've worked for many other companies just like mine who have unique needs? (David C. Baker)

• They start with crystal-clear value proposition:‘Here’s 1) the problem we solve for 2) this specific audience 3) to achieve the following outcomes using 4) this specific approach/methodology.'It’s impossible to misinterpret what the firm does and what its consultants can achieve (early connection with audience and early non-ideal client disqualification!).

• Problem resolution-focused:'Here’s an overview of the prototypical problem(s) and challenges of our clients that we have discovered the past years’ is prioritized over a laundry list of services.

• A bold point of view and a signature methodology:The overview of prototypical client challenges is followed by: ‘Here’s our (bold) point of view regarding these prototypical client problems', setting the context for everything the firm does, and 'here is how we apply our proprietary approach to resolving these challenges.'

• The references:Case studies and testimonials speak about the outcomes that the boutique consultancy was able to achieve as opposed to how friendly the people who work there are;

• The about:They explain how it all started, where the expertise is coming from (re specific audience problems), how they achieve project ‘home runs’, how they engage the stakeholders, how they improve their expertise on an ongoing basis, etc. All inspiring stories about the expertise-legacy of the consultancy. Trust-building, you bet;

• The blog:(Bi)weekly updates, straightforward (specific) problem-resolution advice, educating prospects and clients to discover improvement opportunities, explaining the hidden cost of status quo, picturing ‘the promised land’, explaining ‘old vs new’. And the blog content gets repurposed in social channels consistently;

• The FAQ(yes!): An incredible overview of all sorts of prototypical client questions and even objections (to immediately disqualify non-ideal client) to help the target audience with their decision making;

• The contact form:It's still there, but the focus is on ‘booking a call’ straight into the agenda of the dedicated expert (and all of the above website sections are 100% pre-qualifying information, they hardly ever get calls from non-ideal prospects);

• Traffic to the website:Organically growing week by week, these consultancies become top-of-mind in the market for their capacity of solving specific problems for a specific audience, driven by their educational power;

• When I ask Google:On Page 1 with their core article about essential trends in the industry (why don't you try with me and google: “Trends in consulting” 🤓 ).

I urge boutique consultancies to not wait another day and delete their old-school website. Today. The way their websites currently are – nobody cares anyway. Not the prospects, not Google.

# Every Consulting Firm Needs a Discovery Service

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 07 March 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/every-consulting-firm-needs-a-discovery-service

---

This article was last updated on 7 March 2024.

It has become an all too common story; a company hires a consulting firm to help them with a specific problem and spends a lot of money without any real solution.

In a 2023 UK study, more than 50% of consulting firm clients feel that the value they receive in return for their payment doesn't match up (says this Harvard article).

Unfortunately, this happens because many consultancies rely on the outdated "trial and error" method to solve problems for their clients.

Let me be straightforward here. I would never again start an important consulting project with a new client with such a ‘trial and error’ mindset.

Just like an operator wouldn’t order spare parts for a broken manufacturing machine without a full diagnostic, a consultancy should only propose a contract for a large-scale project with a proper discovery.

And to avoid ‘hit and miss’, I’ve learned to leverage the incredible power of an upfront discovery or diagnosis approach, fully paid.

## What is upfront discovery or diagnosis in consulting?

In today's business climate and complexity, more and more companies seem to turn to consultancy expertise to get an edge on the competition. Depending on the source, all major big consulting firms have grown around 10% (or even more) in the past year, even during difficult economic times. Amazing.

I am currently working with a few high-tech consulting firms to develop an upfront discovery service. This service will help their clients assess their needs and objectives, gaps, and roadblocks and identify potential areas of improvement in the context of the issues they are dealing with.

I’ve been iterating many times already, but here’s my current definition:

> An upfront discovery process in consulting is a systematized method of gathering pertinent information on the client’s pressing business problem, analyzing gaps and roadblocks with the goal of developing an improvement roadmap that will guide the client achieve the desired business outcomes.

An upfront discovery process in consulting is a systematized method of gathering pertinent information on the client’s pressing business problem, analyzing gaps and roadblocks with the goal of developing an improvement roadmap that will guide the client achieve the desired business outcomes.

The deliverable of such an upfront discovery is an IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP.

Below is a picture of my colleague and myself - several years ago - with a printed (on the wall of the meeting room, on special request of the C-person) improvement roadmap (150k discovery project!). It was my biggest (in Euro) ever discovery project.

## The advantages of discovery: the consulting perspective

There are many advantages to the discovery service for consultancies and consulting leaders:

• Deep client understanding:It is crucial to understand the business’s motives, vision, challenges, specific roadblocks, and historical data to grasp the AS/IS of the client fully. The discovery will provide an intimate look into the client’s company and the pressing problem that must be solved.

• Expertise consistency:It allows systematization of the consulting work: almost every new project starts with the same first step – discovery. This creates consistency, high repeatability of analysis, little variability in data sources, and high predictability of outcomes (the roadmap structure and content).

• Mitigating client hesitation: The discovery service not only guarantees a baseline financial commitment but also addresses common client concerns about investing in large-scale projects (in the context of the current difficult economical situation). It allows clients to engage with the consultancy on a smaller, more manageable scale initially reducing the intimidation of a significant upfront commitment, and eventually facilitating a smoother transition to a larger commitment.

• Fewer mistakes: The more discovery projects, the more patterns will be identified, the more precise the roadmap components, and the fewer ‘hits and misses’ or ‘trial and error’ in the ultimate problem resolution proposal. As I always say: repeatability is the foundation for expertise.

• Internal Knowledge Transfer: Discovery projects serve as a training ground, with their documentation acting like live Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This helps in rapidly upskilling new consultants and ensures a robust knowledge transfer within the team.

• Focus and Specialization: Regular discovery projects keep the consultancy focused on its core competencies, continually refining expertise in specific industries and problems. This focus aids in developing a specialized skill set and maintains alignment with strategic objectives.

• Thought Leadership Development: The insights from discovery projects offer rich material for thought leadership. They position the consultancy as an industry expert, providing valuable content for publications and speaking engagements, thereby enhancing visibility and credibility.

• Risk Mitigation: Discovery projects enable consultancies to identify and address potential risks early in the process. By understanding the client's environment and challenges in depth, consultants can foresee obstacles and plan mitigation strategies, reducing the likelihood of project overruns or failures.

• Client Trust and Relationship Building: The initial discovery phase fosters trust and rapport between the consultancy and the client. By investing time to understand the client's needs and challenges thoroughly, consultancies demonstrate their commitment and build a foundation for a long-term, collaborative relationship.

• Efficient Resource Allocation: Discovery helps in the efficient allocation of resources. By gaining a clear understanding of the project scope and requirements upfront, consultancies can allocate the right resources, both in terms of personnel and tools, avoiding wastage and optimizing project execution, both in the discovery project as well as in the ultimate, larger project implementation phase.

• Competitive Advantage: Offering discovery services can differentiate a consultancy in a competitive market. It positions the firm as thorough, client-focused, and committed to delivering effective problem resolutions with a proven methodology and process, which can be a key deciding factor for clients choosing between consultancies.

• Efficient Proposal Development: The improvement roadmap from discovery projects streamlines proposal writing. It enables faster creation of targeted proposals, enhances client engagement, and reduces the need for extensive discussions. This clear roadmap aids in crafting more compelling proposals that closely align with client requirements, improving both efficiency and client satisfaction.

> "Some of the very best consulting work I was a part of (and by best I mean huge value add for client and enriching for the delivery team) was anchored with a dedicated team who led discovery work up front.It was powerful and focused and conveyed great confidence that the client appreciated (and bought) and that the delivery team was then able to follow through and deliver on." (Russell Raath, President at Kotter Inc – Consulting firm)

(Russell Raath, President at Kotter Inc – Consulting firm)

## The advantages of discovery: the client’s perspective

From the client’s perspective, there is one giant reason to start working with a consultancy through a discovery process: the unique information they get on their business, the expert assessment of gaps, and the recommendations that specifically target their pain points and business outcomes. This expert information is of incredible value.

If you ask me: it’s the most inviting format for the client to get ‘expertise in a box’, reduce risk, avoid trial and error, increase decision-making quality and delivery speed, understand the scope and timing, outline their precise involvement, and seize the final output/delivery they will receive.

The entire process, that's what I have experienced multiple times in my own work and in the work of my clients, becomes far more open and honest, encourages greater collaboration and trust, and puts the consultancy's expertise in the picture.

Sounds like a stroke of genius, doesn't it?

## A 4-step model for consultancies

Here’s the 4-step process I’ve been using myself, observing high-performance consultancies use, and teaching my clients. I’ve discovered that it has broad applicability. It works for smaller, 50k projects and projects of €500k or even >1M in scope.

It’s a unique way of conducting consulting projects and remaining in the driver's seat all the time. Consulting leaders can successfully apply it to almost any consulting project. Yes, any.

• Step 1:Performing an upfront discovery, diagnosis, or audit

• Step 2: Develop an improvement roadmap

• Step 3: Develop the ultimate project plan

• Step 4: Provide implementation guidance (advisory retainer)

I will go through each step individually.

### Step 1: Upfront discovery and/or diagnosis

The biggest win? Consulting leaders don’t have to write a proposal immediately.

A consultancy's diagnosis is its fixed-priced methodology to understand the client’s problem and is a stepping stone, a 'Trojan Horse' to (hopefully) start a more significant project, engagement, or long-term client relationship.

Clients commit to a precise and transparent project with a specific result in mind: understanding the outlook and specifics of their problem and receiving a roadmap (Step 2) for improvement.

Included in the consultancy diagnostic: every possible characteristic of the prototypical client pain it is specialized in. And all these characteristics are the input for the roadmap in Step 2.

### Step 2: Improvement roadmap as the core deliverable

The upfront discovery or diagnosis leads to Step 2, creating a so-called improvement roadmap. It is a consultancy's critical strategic process of determining the actions, chronological steps, and resources needed to solve the client’s problem.

'Roadmapping' is often falsely assumed as the act of designing a roadmap. Huh. Indeed, a vital output of the roadmapping process is a roadmap :-).

However, creating such a roadmap requires a synthesis of all the knowledge and expertise of a consultancy. It determines all the significant components and the prioritization hierarchy to solve the client's problem. And most importantly, it also secures buy-in and support from executive stakeholders.

On top, roadmapping supports structured visual narratives in workshops and beyond. I had great collaboration experiences with it.

Here are a couple of resources consulting leaders and their teams can use to help with roadmapping:

• Thevirtual collaboration tool Mirohas a special section on roadmapping. Consultancies can use their roadmap templates to collaborate with their client. (Enter the search term ‘roadmap’ in the Miro search bar.)

• Cambridge Universityhas a department that provides roadmapping expertise and training! Great expertise!

### Step 3: The ultimate project proposal

The risk of writing an inadequate proposal is always greater without an upfront discovery phase. When the final project goes without discovery, I am 90% sure it will cost more time and money to get started because there won't be enough information even to understand why certain decisions were made during the proposal preparation.

The proposal produced as a result of an upfront discovery project will be much more detailed and tailored than what would have been developed without it. The client gave full access, allowing for an in-depth assessment of the pressing problem(s) they'd like to solve.

A few important tips

• The roadmap is the proposal:The discovery roadmap is the consulting leaders' expert guide to developing the proposal (all the problem and resolution components are in the roadmap, right?).

• Assessing the quality of your roadmap? Consultancy owners should ask themselves: can competitors steal this roadmap and start doing a flawless implementation with it? If yes, the consultancy has done an excellent job.

• Delivery capacity check:The depth of involvement of the consulting firm depends on the capacity to deliver. Big consulting firms with excess capacity can go all the way and do both upstream (strategic, C-level guidance) and downstream (implementation, execution) work. For smaller, boutique consulting firms, I'd recommend to reverse-engineer the roadmap based on the availabe capacity and/or expertise.

• Roadmap ownership:It's important that consulting leaders ensure that the client owns the roadmap implementation. Of course, the consulting firm is there to guide and support the implementation, but the client remains accountable for the ultimate success. I've always guided my clients to become self-sufficient one day. Even if that feels counter-intuitive for a consulting firm, clients ultimately will need to move on and adopt the changes. Giving self-sufficiency guidance is a big trust-builder!

### Step 4: The long tail, the advisory retainer, the client’s ‘peace of mind’

Several of my current consulting clients are keen to sell advisory retainers after full project delivery.

The client is buying ‘peace of mind’ over a more extended period (e.g., 6 or 12 months) and pays ‘access to the consultancy’ to look over the shoulder of the client, giving guidance for further implementation and/or adoption.

‘Being available’ is the essential difference between ‘pay for access’ (upstream advisory retainer) versus ‘pay for work’ (downstream implementation work). Again, it depends on the size of the consulting firm (capacity to deliver) to choose between upstream or downstream post-project support or guidance.

I’d always advise consulting owners to give the advisory retainer a basic structure, such as reviewing the roadmap monthly or quarterly with the team or the C-person (preferably) in an (e.g., 90') workshop format.

By the way, even the big, famous management consulting firms (you know their names, right?) seem to offer more and more of these advisory retainers. They are 'staying close' to the CEO or other C-level execs to give them transformation guidance and peace of mind. It seems to be a new trend and, of course, an excellent business development strategy. I've seen high-performing consultancies of small and medium size adopt such a strategy.

There’s much great content about advisory retainers that explain the pros and cons, reasons, costs, payments, etc. Here’s agreat article from Hubspot(my business software).

Two watch-outs I experienced with my clients.

• C-level only:I recommend that consulting leaders limit their contact to the C-level (or senior project owner) and avoid getting dragged into the implementation work by the implementation team (being in cc in hundreds of emails). That’s why consultancies better define the boundaries of their retainer (e.g., 1x workshop per month for roadmap review, C-level only, etc.).

• Volume risk:Selling advisory retainers is a great way to have predictable revenue, but consultancy owners also have to be careful to oversell and run out of capacity suddenly with too many retainers.

## Pricing the discovery consulting services

I've always been a big fan of openly pricing a discovery service. There are two ways to go about pricing a consultancy's discovery/diagnostic service:

• Fix fee:communicating a standard, fixed fee that a client of any size needs to commit to paying. Although it's easier to sell, I'd never recommend fixed pricing. Why not? See next bullet point. But, if the projects have a similar size all the time (difficult to imagine, though), fixed pricing is more straightforward.

• Fee range:communicating a fee range (e.g., 30-80k for SMEs or 50-150K for Enterprises) depending on the size of the company a consultancy is taking on as a client. The logic here is that the larger the company, the more potential stakeholders consulting leaders would have to involve in the discovery process. It's important to remember that the pricing here is more flexible but the discovery process is set and non-negotiable. For the (big scale) 150k roadmap of the picture above, we did almost 30 interviews (much work, including the planning to get those busy people on the agenda).

## Examples of 3 discovery consulting services consultancy owners can learn from

Having spoken to 200+ consultants, dozens of whom were my clients, there are several excellent examples of consultancies offering discovery-roadmap-advisory services that I’ve aggregated. Here are a few examples.

Example 1: Salesforce post-M&A integration consultancy (boutique high-performance consultancy, experts in merging Salesforce after large-scale enterprise M&A):

• Step 1: diagnosis (they call it 'an audit') of integration challenges, opportunities, duration estimation, and cost estimation

• Step 2: a roadmap to integrate the two systems (mainly done by the client with expert guidance)

• Step 3: client implements with the expert guidance of the consultants

• Step 4: CIO gets personal guidance for 12 months (advisory retainer)

• Step 1: diagnosis of improvement opportunities (understanding the process of both marketing qualified leads and sales qualified leads)

• Step 2: a roadmap to enhance the internal sales process, including the development of playbooks and a training program (delivered by consultants)

• Step 3: the agreed roadmap gets implemented in co-creation with the internal team, mostly 70-80% of the workload is for the consulting firm

• Step 4: CMO and CSO getting personal guidance for 12 months (with one workshop per month - follow-thru of the roadmap) and execution of training program (to help clients get self-sufficient)

Example 3: Retail demand forecasting improvements (midsized consulting firm, experts in automating supermarketdemand forecasting using AI):

• Step 1: a feasibility study to uncover demand forecast improvement opportunities, including initial opportunity-based cost estimations.

• Step 2: a roadmap to improve demand forecasting, with much focus on the assessment of data availability and data quality

• Step 3: implementation of a new demand forecast program in 2 phases (phase 1 by consultancy only, phase 2 in co-creation, including a training program for the CoE analytics with a self-sufficiency objective)

• Step 4: 6-12 months of personal guidance for the demand forecasting leader

## The pushback I sometimes get

When I explain how it works, consulting leaders usually become convinced or even enthusiastic. However, some of them explained their concerns. Here’s an overview of why they sometimes push back and a summary of (some of) my typical answers to their pushback.1. Progression to Larger Projects

• Pushback: Consulting leaders fear showcasing expertise in smaller discovery projects may not lead to larger engagements.

• My response: I highlight how discovery phases build trust, demonstrate value, and show examples of how these can lead to larger, successful projects.

2. Lack of Standardisation

• Pushback: Firms lack a standardised approach, making leaders hesitant to offer discovery phases that might seem inconsistent.

• My response: I advocate for creating a standardised discovery process that effectively introduces the consultancy's methodologies and capabilities. Of course, if there’s a lack of focus or specialisation, that’ll be a difficult job. Another reason to focus more?

3. Perceived Lower Value of Discovery Projects

• Pushback: There's a belief that discovery services are seen as less valuable by clients, who may prefer immediate solutions.

• My response: I always suggest explaining a discovery project as a crucial investment for strategic planning and groundwork, essential for successful project completion in a later phase.

4. Resource Allocation Concerns

• Pushback: Allocating skilled consultants to less lucrative discovery projects is seen as diverting focus from more profitable work.

• My response: I always suggest forming a specialised (small) team for discovery phases to maintain efficiency and emphasise this as an investment in long-term client relationships.

5. Integration with Existing Business Development Processes

• Pushback: There's often concern about the difficulty of incorporating discovery services into current business development and project initiation methods.

• My response: I always propose a straightforward integration approach for discovery services, including business development and consulting team(s) training and compelling communication materials to blend it smoothly into existing prospection and pitching processes.

#### But here's the thing...

These concerns, while understandable, might be holding consultancies back from embracing the true potential of the discovery service.

In reality, the success of the discovery model has been demonstrated across diverse consultancies and circumstances. I've experienced it myself as an incredibly powerful business development tool that not only offered clients a clear path to understanding their needs but also allowed my consultancy to showcase our expertise in a controlled and valuable manner.

The key lies in recognizing that the discovery phase isn't just a preliminary step; it's a strategic opportunity.

By addressing these pushback points head-on, consultancies can reframe their approach, harnessing the power of discovery to not only secure initial engagements but to build the trust and confidence needed to guide clients toward larger, more impactful projects.

It's time to trust in the proven success of the discovery service and leverage it as a catalyst for expertise reputation, business development, consultancy growth and client satisfaction.

## A few tips and tricks

Standardizing discovery services is an important element of the consulting business approach that I advocate. Here are a few lessons I learned in my consulting work and what I am experiencing with my clients.

• Focus (1):The narrower the focus and expertise of the consulting firm, the easier it is to build a discovery approach. For consultancies with a mix of practices and/or expertise domains, it can be a heck of a job as they will need to understand all the patterns of the prototypical pains of their multiple target audiences. It requires solid experience and training of the team, so consultancy owners should think twice. I know a few 'multiple-audiences consultancies' that have developed discovery services but only for a limited number of strategic expertise domains (e.g., digital transformation).

• Focus (2):I urge consultancy owners and consulting leaders to not take on clients outside of the scope of their ideal client. Their deliverables (from the roadmap) will not match their expectations. Why? Because their components of the discovery and the roadmap MUST be of the highest possible standardization, and the only way to achieve that is by sticking to the same target audience (with similar problems).

• Visibility and trust:I cannot advise it enough. Consulting leaders must keep sharing their discovery case studies as much and as broadly as possible, and allocate enough time for the writing and distribution. I've always experienced that prospects are impressed by a robust discovery approach and quickly start trusting the consulting firm's expertise.

• UX:Consultancies must strive for a 5-star experience in how they execute the diagnostic (e.g., automated questionnaires, top-notch reporting, top interview style, and advanced data gathering). The high-end visual delivery of the roadmap (e.g., with the virtual roadmap toolMiro.com) will be a key reference point to build market trust. I am currently usingScoreApp.comfor my discovery questionnaires, with automated high-level reporting which becomes input for my client workshops.

• Agile:I recommend that consultancy owners start building a discovery service in small steps, carefully testing and validating their approach before going big.

• Upstream:Consultancies should beware of becoming the ‘order taker’ of the project leader, and make sure they stay away from getting in cc in team email streams. As the expert, the consultancy is the strategic advisor and provide ‘peace of mind’ for its C-level clients.

## In conclusion

Offering discovery services as a standard business development approach is an excellent way for consultancy owners to leverage the expertise of their consultancies.

Clients will be happier and more relaxed, knowing exactly how to recommend this consultancy's discovery expertise to their network.

Discovery and roadmap development are not about eliminating customization. It’s about leveraging deep expertise to categorize prospects’ pain points and needs. It’s about creating transparent expectations with new clients and delivering a 5-star experience.

The discovery-based consulting model that I suggest will work for any consultancy, irrespective of the size or project scope. It's also a way for a owners to turn their firms into high-performance consultancies.

# 5 Reasons Consulting Leaders Are Missing the Digital Train

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 01 March 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/5-reasons-consulting-leaders-are-missing-the-digital-train

---

This article was last updated on 1 March 2024.I’d like to start with a few stats:

• 50% of senior executives find thought leadership through advisories’ websites, emails, and newsletters.

• 42% come across it when doing online research.

• 38% discover such pieces through social media posts

To add to that:

• 78% of senior executives agree that good thought leadership would make them consider working with the advisor or solutions provider who produced it.

• 72% agree that if their own advisor or solutions provider doesn’t produce thought leadership on their priorities, they’ll look at their competitors.

I’ve taken all of the above states fromGrist’s studyon thought leadership. While this highly insightful yearly research piece is full of other useful data points, one thing is clear – decision-makers have embraced digital channels as the main medium for content discovery.AND, they expect thought leadership content from their existing or potential advisory partners.So, if the evidence is there, why are consulting leaders lagging in driving digital growth?In my experience working with owners and leaders of mid-sized consultancies, there are five bottlenecks – or, potentially, five improvement opportunities.

## #1. Shifting from relationship-first to digital-first business development

There’s still too much focus on relationship building/maintaining, which, for a while now, has been a risky business development approach because it is not a sustainable long-term strategy and is not scalable.Relying solely on existing relationships for new business can lead to a lack of diversification in clients and revenue streams.Additionally, if those relationships were to change or end, the consulting business would be at risk of losing a significant portion of its income.It is important for consulting businesses to have a well-rounded business development strategy that includes building and maintaining relationships but is digitally first. And that these relationships are based on impactful, outcomes-driven, highly targeted value propositions.Recommended reading:Relying On the Network Is A High-Risk Consulting Growth Strategy

## #2. Sharing expertise: from old-school to new-school archetype

There’s a chasm between an old-school and a new-school mindset. The old-school consultancy refuses to share its expertise. The belief is that clients and competitors will steal their know-how. The new-school consultancy believes in the power of sharing/educating and considers it strategic.

Trust in a consulting leader comes from helping others achieve their promised land. The old-school archetype consulting leader doesn’t fit that ‘trust model’. The true measure of a consulting leader‘s worth is not in the short-term gains they achieve but in the long-term capabilities they develop in their clients.

> Being visible in the market as a consultant or consultancy is extremely important. Visibility done right means you don’t have to worry about having to sell your consulting services all the time. Sharing your generous knowledge, your point of view, your display of genuine understanding of your target audience’s pain points, and your ability to address them will do the selling for you.

Being visible in the market as a consultant or consultancy is extremely important. Visibility done right means you don’t have to worry about having to sell your consulting services all the time. Sharing your generous knowledge, your point of view, your display of genuine understanding of your target audience’s pain points, and your ability to address them will do the selling for you.

Expertise-sharing should be done consistently and based on the value proposition of the consultancy. That means each piece – be it a blog article, a guest post, a speaking engagement, a case study, or a LinkedIn post – serves to communicate the value proposition of the consultancy. It acts as proof of the deep expertise in a narrow field. It showcases the consultancy's ability to deliver measurable, high-value outcomes based on that expertise. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the pain points of the target audience.

## #3. Establishing a growth marketing function

Marketing in most consultancies wasn't hired as a growth marketing function, so consulting leaders don't see value in working with these marketers.At best, somebody in marketing 'does the social media', but that's not digital growth marketing. So consultancies need to hire growth marketers.How can they make a difference?When consulting leaders and consultancy owners work together with marketers, these marketers can develop an editorial calendar, optimize thought leadership pieces for search engines, and measure the reach and engagement rate of every piece.They can track conversion rates, recycle and update content, use all the data points to suggest changes in the strategy and provide consulting leaders with topic ideas, and so much more. All of these activities should be geared towards the ultimate goal of growing the revenue and based on the value proposition that the entire consultancy is aligned around.Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Reach the Unconverted Audience in 4 Steps

## #4. Eliminating the ‘client work first’ shortsighted thinking

Consulting leaders keep telling the story of 'client work first' but are fooling themselves in the long run. They believe that it’s up to marketers to increase the exposure of the consultancy.However, driving exposure to the consultancy is the role of the leader. They need to do that by regularly producing authoritative educational content that addresses the very heart of the challenges that their target audience deals with.Marketing brochures don’t get shared. They don’t get forwarded to the network. They don’t get clicked on in newsletters. Content pieces that offer insights, predict trends, inspire action are the ones that get traction.The role of marketing is to scale this exposure. And that’s why collaboration between consulting leaders and marketers is critical.Recommended reading:Consulting Leaders, Stop Outsourcing Your Thought Leadership Responsibility to Marketing!

## #5. Adding discipline to value proposition

Digital marketing requires discipline in the value proposition – its design and how it's communicated internally and externally. Unfortunately, consulting leaders love to keep all options open and say yes to all kinds of client requests. That’s a big bottleneck.Laser-sharp, impactful value proposition is key to digital marketing success. It’s at the foundation of everything the consultancy does:

• How individual consultants communicate with prospects

• How consultants present their expertise and services

• What subjects consulting leaders create educational pieces around

• Which prospects to target and what incoming requests to turn down

• What to look for in prospective hiresand so much more.

> Poorly positioned consultancies will always struggle with a multitude of business development goals. They often get under mental pressure to start selling downstream availability (order takers instead of transformational experts) and usually start overservicing the clients at too low a price.Poor positioning is a losing battle in both visibility and trust-building with prospects.

Value proposition design is used to (1) align the expertise and service offering of a consultancy with the high-priority needs of a narrow audience, and (2) set up strong criteria upon which to make business development and marketing decisions.Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design

## In conclusion

We live in a world where information is at our fingertips. “Google” is used as a verb. Don’t know the answer to a question? Google it! And C-level executives are Googling it.They are looking for answers to resolve their pain points. They are reading newsletters. They are browsing through web sites of consultancies. They have fully embraced digital channels.So if consulting leaders want to be serious about growing their consulting business and starting to attract ideal clients in a more consistent and predictable way, they will have to get comfortable with digital marketing and learn how to consistently expand their digital footprint based on a well thought out value proposition.We live in a new digital-first consulting world.

# The Two Most Visible Indicators of a High-Performing Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 20 February 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-two-most-visible-indicators-of-a-high-performing-boutique-consultancy

---

I work with owner-led, mid-size boutique consultancies. It’s my area of expertise. It’s to what I dedicate every single minute of my work time. I audit them, I learn from them, I read articles and studies, I write blog and LinkedIn posts about these types of consulting firms, and I guest-host webinars on this subject.

I identify problem areas, audit foundational elements, help build roadmaps, distill lessons learned from high-performing consultancies into actionable advice – all of this results in a giant pool of data and knowledge. Over time, patterns reveal themselves.

One such pattern that I’ve observed is that consultancy performance can be distilled into two dominant, extremely visible indicators. These high-performing consultancies have:

• A reliable new client inbound motion - to fuel growth

• A well-built blueprint for existing client development - to fuel stability

Surprising in their simplicity yet transformative implications, these outcomes are the essence of consultancy excellence.That’s what I’ll be delving into in this article.

## 1. A reliable new client inbound motion of high-performing boutique consultancies

Isn’t it the ultimate dream of every consultancy: having clients come to it rather than constantly chasing new leads?It signifies its expertise reputation, its ability to provide problem resolutions that resonate with its target audience. It's a sign of trust and value, making it crucial for sustained success.High-performing consultancies excel at inbound motion. I am always amazed at the precision and effectiveness of inbound client acquisition that high-performing boutique consultancies display.I’ve been keeping track of all the foundational elements these consultancies share as well as the indicators that show the impact of their new client inbound motion. After months (though, more like 2+ years) of this exercise, I have narrowed down them down to the ones that I see in practically every single instance of a high-performing boutique consulting firm.

### The foundations of the inbound motion

• Laser-Sharp Positioning: A consultancy's ability to clearly define its expertise domain and target audience is fundamental. Laser-sharp positioning ensures that the consultancy addresses the specific needs of its ideal clients.

• Attractive Value Proposition: An irresistible value proposition showcases what sets the consultancy apart and why clients should choose it over competitors. It communicates the unique benefits and solutions offered.

• Expertise-Driven Thought Leadership: By openly sharing problem-resolution expertise consistently, actively engaging with the audience, and providing valuable insights, consultancies build credibility and trust.

• Frictionless Buyer Journeys: Streamlined, user-friendly buyer journeys make it easy for potential clients to engage with the consultancy. Simplicity is paramount.

• Trust-Building Entry Services: Offering entry or discovery services that are both appealing and confidence-building can lead to long-lasting client relationships. These services provide a glimpse into the consultancy's expertise.

• Repeatable, Proven Methodology: A well-defined and repeatable methodology with predictable outcomes is reassuring to clients. It showcases the consultancy's ability to deliver results consistently.

• Excellence in Service Delivery & Impact: Proven by outcome-based client testimonials, service excellence is a testament to the consultancy's commitment to client success. These testimonials provide social proof and build trust.

### The outcomes of new client inbound motion

A strong inbound motion in a consultancy is typically characterized by several key outcomes that have both immediate and long-term impacts on performance. Here is the main impact of a strong new client inbound motion that I’ve experienced in the past years:

• Lower Cost of Acquisition (CAC): A strong inbound motion always leads to a significantly lower CAC as clients proactively seek the consultancy's services. This ‘no-need-to-chase-new-clients’ results in substantial cost savings and improved profitability.

• Higher Conversion Rates: Inbound leads are more likely to convert into new clients, leading to higher conversion rates than any other outbound method I know of.

• Reduced Sales Cycle: Inbound clients typically have shorter sales cycles as they are already interested and engaged with the consultancy's content and offerings. ‘Let’s get this started’, I got told many times.

• Easier Procurement Pass-through: Inbound clients often require less convincing during the procurement process, leading to smoother and more straightforward assessments and saving time and resources (leading to the reduced sales cycle).

• Improved Pricing: Clients attracted to the problem-resolution expertise of the consultancy may be more willing to accept premium prices for consultancy services, resulting in improved average deals and higher profitability.

• More Predictable Revenue: A strong inbound motion provides a higher level of predictability of future revenue streams, making financial planning and resource allocation more manageable and creating a higher degree of stability in the consultancy (and in the head of its leaders).

• Improved Profit & Project Margins: With lower acquisition costs, a higher proportion of converted leads, better pricing, and enhanced average deals, consultancies can enjoy improved gross margin and net profit.

• Better Client Retention: Inbound clients tend to be more satisfied and loyal, leading to higher client retention rates, the starting point for the ‘existing client development motion’ (will be the next post).

• Easier Referral Business: Satisfied inbound clients are more likely to refer new business, further contributing to new client acquisition and revenue growth.

These indicators - to name a few from my experience in the past years - collectively contribute to the overall performance of a consultancy. While some results may be immediate, others may take time to fully materialize though.

I’ve been there in the iNostix/Deloitte years: our strong inbound motion was the ultimate foundation for high-margin, predictable revenue.

## 2. A well-built blueprint for existing client development at high-performing boutique consultancies

I advise the 30/70 ambition consultancies should target:

• 30% of the revenue from new clients - inbound - to fuel growth

• 70% of the revenue from developing existing clients - to fuel stability

I always clarify that this is not an exact science. Rather, it’s something that I recommend boutique consultancies aspire to.

Why? Because it puts revenue stability and predictability first. At the same time, targeting around 30% of revenue to come from new clients means keeping the service offering fresh, keeping the prices competitive, generating new success stories, and safeguarding the pipeline from going stale.Just like with new client inbound motion, I have noticed that high-performing boutique consultancies share foundational elements and indicators when it comes to developing the relationships with existing clients.

### The pillars for sustained existing client development

• Project Success: It all starts with ongoing project success, the heart of retaining existing clients and opening the door for continued development. It goes beyond meeting deadlines, scope and budgets. It's about delivering value and impact that build trust and advance the client journey, paving the way for ongoing collaboration.

• Proactive Client Engagement: Client retention and development requires proactively fostering client engagement by maintaining consistent communication through regular check-ins, feedback loops, and project updates. Enhancing the relationship by conducting structured gap analysis sessions to understand evolving challenges.Consultancies may want to consider offering educational interventions, facilitating open round table discussions, and hosting private webinars on relevant topics such as market trends and new technologies. Other best practices I’ve observed are involving clients in co-creating upcoming project steps and providing support in implementing client success programs to ensure a holistic approach to the client’s problem resolution.

• Service Offering Design: One of my favorite approaches is offering additional value-added services or solutions that align with existing clients' evolving needs and delivering value over an extended period (vs one-off, short-term projects). It includes implementing strategies such as ongoing adoption monitoring and corrective interventions, introducing subscription-based or retainer-based support models, vertical service integration (solutions that span from broad strategic advice to highly specialized, granular interventions), implementing managed services, strategic CXO guidance, scheduled service reviews, roadmap and client journey design, programmatic delivery (automation, datafication, monitoring), platform delivery, managed services, ongoing data analysis & reporting, and budget planning support (to name a few).

• Key Account Management: Experienced key account management focusing on developing trusted partnerships at the executive or C-level (high ‘altitude of involvement’) because that’s where the best client development happens. This is a crucial role for the consultancy owner(s), partners or leaders.Research by Sourceunderpins the importance of account management.It found that 45% of clients end up spending more on individual projects due to the influence of their account manager.Furthermore, 54% of clients commissioned extra work due to great account management.Finally, 71% of clients receiving legal services ended association with their service provider due to poor account management.These findings show both the tremendous potential of good account management and the serious risks of poor/inexistent account management.

• It found that 45% of clients end up spending more on individual projects due to the influence of their account manager.

• Furthermore, 54% of clients commissioned extra work due to great account management.

• Finally, 71% of clients receiving legal services ended association with their service provider due to poor account management.

### The outcomes of the sustained existing client development

If consultancies excel at developing existing clients over an extended period, in my experience, these outcomes become visible consistently:

• Revenue per FTE improvement:Business development capacityimprovement of the teamBetter efficiencyin leveraging resources to drive revenue (non-linear growth)

• Better margins: Long-term client development is a key strategy for improving project margins in consulting firms. Here’s how it makes a difference:Enhanced Delivery Productivity: Familiarity with client needs and processes streamlines workflow, reducing the need for onboarding and increasing efficiency.Better Resource Planning: Understanding the client's future needs allows for more precise allocation of the right talent, minimizing downtime and underutilization.Effective Scope Management: Long-standing relationships, in my experience, facilitate clearer communication, helping to manage project scope and avoid unnecessary scope creep.Premium Pricing: The trust and value established over time enable firms to negotiate (or maintain) higher rates for specialized services.

• Revenue reliability: Revenue reliability plays a crucial role in the stability and growth of consulting firms. It ensures consistent performance through:Stability: Predictable revenue streams provide a solid foundation, reducing volatility and enhancing business resilience.Easier Pipeline Management: Knowing what revenue to expect simplifies managing the sales pipeline and prioritizing efforts.Accurate Revenue Forecasting: Reliable revenue makes it easier to project future earnings, aiding in strategic decision-making.Efficient Resource Planning: With predictable revenue, firms can allocate resources more effectively, matching workforce planning with anticipated projects.Improved Financial Health: Consistent revenue flow supports better cash flow management, investment in growth opportunities, and financial planning.Peace of Mind and Reduced Stress: The assurance of steady revenue alleviates the pressure of constantly needing to chase new clients, leading to a more stable work environment and better quality of life for all involved.

## In conclusion

High-performing consultancies are not born. They are carefully crafted. They are operating at maximum efficiency. Like a Swiss clock, they are precise in everything they do.However, it doesn’t happen overnight. Every high-performing boutique consultancy has to go through the laborious process of setting up the initial business, determining the narrow market, and deepening the expertise to the point where it can provide transformational value to clients. Every single one had to build up a library of authoritative content and social proof in the form of case studies and testimonials.The ones who made it to the top? They are the ones that understand how the buyers’ market and purchasing habits have evolved, and actively incorporate it in their client acquisition and client retention strategies. They understand that to achieve these fantastic levels of success, they need to stand out, they need to be known for exceptional expertise, and they need to maintain a healthy balance between nurturing existing clients and continuously acquiring new ones at low cost.

# Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting Business

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 15 February 2024
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-you-should-share-your-expertise-to-grow-your-consulting-business

---

This article was last updated on 15 February 2024.

Putting in the rigorous effort toward creating valuable content that was focused on educating my audience all those years gave me the privilege of becoming a solid ‘visible authority’ globally. It didn’t happen overnight, though. It took a lot of discipline, hard work, a structured approach, and a laser-sharp focus.

> "Don’t settle for short-term content vanity. It’s the people who stick with it the longest, that reap the largest rewards (Nicolas Cole)

I’ve never been afraid of educating my audience by openly sharing all my expertise.

People often ask me: ‘Why the heck are you openly sharing all your expertise and learnings? Aren’t you afraid that, by sharing your ‘secrets’, your clients won’t need you anymore?

My easy and relaxed answer to this is that clients must know, like, and trust us before they buy. It’s the essence of good content marketing. Consulting is a credence business, and sharing your expertise through educative content is the only thing that can build this trust (and visibility).

Let me provide you with a personal example. I gave the opening keynote speech at an international conference a few years ago. The learnings I’d presented had intrigued this HRD. She asked me for my contact information and promised to call me to discuss a collaboration.Months went by, without a single call from her. However, she kept receiving my new case studies in the background as she was subscribed to our email list. Six months later, her assistant called for a meeting.It was one of those many meetings where I sat in front of the ‘buyer’ with a printed stack of my case studies and articles on the desk. She apologized for the delay in getting back to me. She had to prepare a business case for consultancy investment, which took her a while.“Your case studies and articles had been my best source of information to prepare the business case for your support,” she admitted to me with a big smile.The HR Director finally got the approval from her boss (just before we met), and at the end of our meeting, she gave me the go-ahead for one of the most rewarding consulting projects I’ve ever done. Amazing!This project with the HR Director was born out of having openly shared all my learnings. That’s what the client told me, at least.The collaboration ‘pitch’ (the 60' meeting in her office) was nothing more than a friendly handshake to get started right away.No need to explain, persuade, sell, or negotiate.

## 10 Reasons why consultancies shouldn't be afraid of sharing their expertise

1. Expertise tops content.

Clients are looking for the bigger picture: the qualifications and years of experience that a consultancy brings to the table. Content can never replace that! Clients pay to help them to apply a consultancy's expertise to their specific situation.

By openly sharing expertise, a consultancy sends a message that its consultants are not afraid to reveal their expertise because they are that confident in their own skills and knowledge. It sends a powerful message that the consulting firm has much more to offer because of how freely its consultants share their knowledge.

2. Content doesn't replace implementation.

Even with profound reading about experiences and learnings from other projects, most non-experts will always struggle with executing a complex implementation, even with a step-by-step instruction ‘the IKEA-way’. If prospects need support, the educational content provided by a consultancy will never be THE solution to them. But THE CONSULTANCY is!

3. Content builds trust.

Educating the target audience is the best possible way to build a strong and credible reputation as a consultancy. Without trust in their expertise, consulting firms won’t get that call to meet. And if prospects don’t call, consultancies will never know, unfortunately. I learned this from Seth Godin: 'Give people an abundance of confidence in your expertise by creating an abundance of value and share it again and again.'

*Recommended reading:Shaping Your Consultancy’s Thought Leadership To Accelerate Growth*

> "Show your prospects who you are, what you do, how you solve client problems, what clients can learn from your experience, your struggles and failures.

4. Content builds visibility.

If a consultancy is reluctant to embrace content-driven marketing, nobody will ever find it on the internet. In a world where professional services buyers act like consumers and can find anything in seconds, how on earth will this firm be found? As Google’sSEO Starter Guideputs it, “Creating compelling and useful content will likely influence your website more than any of the other factors discussed here.”

Did you know that 90% of professional service buyers check out a consultant’s expertise online before making a decision whether or not to get in touch with them? And did you know that a striking 80% of potential consultants and consultancies put themselves out of the picture straight away because of their poor online profile and/or the lack of visible expertise? (Data from Hinge Research Institute)

5. Audience education builds a mental connection.

The more a consultancy writes about how THEY have solved the problems of their clients, the more clients will relate to them and build a mental connection with them over time. Important though: the writing should be pain-resolution educational content. Clients should immediately recognize their pains in the stories shared by consultancies (that's what I did: storytelling from the problem-solving project trenches).

The more you open up, the more people will relate to you! (Tim Denning)

Furthermore, as Adam Grant explains in his New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller bookGive and Take, fostering more generosity can significantly impact success in both individual careers and organizational performance. Heexplains his research, which revealed that generosity fosters a sense of community and trust. It encourages collaboration. It also creates a ripple effect throughout organizations when a leader displays generosity and fosters generosity-based culture. Finally, generosity is directly connected to one's sense of happiness.

6. Writing & sharing content deepens a consultancy's expertise.

There's no better way for consulting firms to deepen their expertise than writing about it and sharing it. In the words of one of my great 'masters', Nobel Price winner Feynman (known for his ability to clearly explain difficult topics such as quantum physics for virtually everybody): 'The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another'.

7. Sharing content provides consultancies with data.

I am obsessed with studying and researching what my prospects and existing clients are reading from me, how much time they invest in reading my stuff, what exactly they focus on when going through my content, how often they come back to read, how long they stay on my blog, what their click-thru behaviors are, etc.

It's the most important research database to understand the interests & behaviors of a consultancy's prospects and clients. I couldn't have been successful in the past without these data, you bet.8. Content sharing is a pre-qualification tool.

In the early years of my consulting work, I received quite a big volume of inquiry calls from 'non-ideal' clients. However, the more I wrote about the work I was doing, the more 'ideal clients' calls I got. Step by step, my writing (and speaking) became my most important client pre-qualification tool.

The prospects who contacted me knew exactly what I was doing, which problems I was solving, what kind of projects I was involved in. In fact, once my content-driven visibility got established, I almost never got non-ideal inquiries anymore.

*Recommended reading:How I Share My Expertise with My Audience of Consultancy Owners9. Educating the audience propels conversion.*

Regularly publishing authoritative, educational, unique content is not a feel-good strategy that can’t really be measured. It’s a data-driven approach to maximize the return on investment - the investment of a consultancy's time, effort, and other resources dedicated to creating thoughtful content pieces.

Here’s the stat to prove that: Website conversion rate is nearly6x higherfor content marketing adopters than non-adopters (2.9% vs 0.5%)!

Whether consultancies like it or not but their content is the key driver of the TLC process: from Traffic to Leads to Clients. About 80% of the traffic to my website originates from the content that I am sharing. My content has always been like 'my assets': the more I wrote, the more traffic and ultimately the more clients I got. Consultancies' content should be organized in such a way it drives leads to their business. Sounds like a no-brainer, or?

And, of course, the ROI of educating the audience and sharing expertise in the form of thought leadership content is in the growth of subscribers. Growing a subscriber's list empowers consultancies to communicated directly to their target audience and is one of the best ways to share their content. It's a growth loop – the more valuable content they share, the more subscribers they will accumulate, the more opportunities they get to share their content.

10. Content is an alternative hiring tool.

For about a decade, I received an almost infinite number of spontaneous applications of top experts who wanted to work with me/us. They had been reading my content and became keen to join what we were doing. Just like with prospects, content allows consultancies to build trust with candidates. If they can't find anything 'trust-building' about a consultancy, this firm will struggle much more to attract top talent (or contractors to support growth).

Related Content:Why Are Consultancies Appointing New Partners Without a Voice?

## Consultancies should not worry about competitors. They should be leaders!

“But Luk, aren’t we just revealing all our secrets to our competitors?” I get a variation of this question pretty often. To be frank, the thought of competitors trying to “steal my thunder” never really crossed my mind when I was developing my authority and market recognition.

Sure, consultancies' competitors will get a better understanding of what they do and how they do it. So what? Competitors can’t replicate what these firms know and how they deliver value. The ultimate value comes from the knowledge and the ability to translate that knowledge into problem-solving work consulting companies deliver for their clients. Content is a way to make the target audience aware of the expertise, to develop trust, and gain visibility. It’s never going to replace what consultancies can deliver to their clients.

So any attempts by competition to replicate a consultancy's content will come off as inauthentic. And buyers, when given a choice, will always pick the original, not a copycat.

### Clients prefer to work with leaders - with winners

As a subject matter expert, a consultancy should see its role as that of a leader. Leaders proactively raise questions that other consulting businesses hesitate to ask. Leaders discover patterns and trends. Leaders educate. Leaders do not offer superficial solutions. When addressing problems, they go to the very heart of the issue. Leaders are generous with their knowledge because they are confident in the value of their offering.

And here’s the thing – the market knows. Prospects know which consultancies are considered to be leaders.

• They know because they came across their insightful content;

• They know because their colleagues and peers mentioned the names of these firms;

• They know because these consultancies' employees are sought-after speakers at relevant industry events.

### The potential damage of not sharing is far greater

According toGrist’s researchfindings, 91% of senior executives see thought leadership as critical or important to who they choose as advisor. So consultancies should think about all the potential clients they are guaranteed to miss out on without a thought-leadership-based educational content strategy.

I urge consultancies to adopt a leader’s mindset and not worry about their competitors. Firms that are able to do that will be looking at their competitors in the rearview mirror anyway.

## Conclusion

Marketing in consulting isn’t about pushing a product or service on a customer who doesn’t need it.

Instead, marketing is about educating the audience and providing something of authentic value to followers, prospects or clients.

A consulting company's expertise is probably not truly exceptional but THE COMPANY AND ITS CONSULTANTS certainly are. Consultancies struggling to start developing content can start by telling the authentic story of their project struggles, suffering in the trenches, dealing with bottlenecks, the way they've solved critical client problems, and what others can learn from it.

Even if all of this could be profoundly personal, potential clients will quickly recognize their own problems in these story and can truly connect with the consulting businesses.

# 10 Consulting Trends: 2024 Edition

---

Welcome to the 2024 edition of Consulting Trends – a yearly summary of what I observe happening in the consulting industry, focusing on mid-sized, boutique consultancies.The trends I discuss here are not based on scientific research or a single study. Rather, they are a culmination of what I’ve observed over the past year 2023 and the conclusions from these observations.This overview of the state of the market and consulting industry is based on three main sources:

• My project work with my consultancy clients – the consultancy business audits and the advisory work that I complete;

• The discussions and interactions I’ve had with more than 100 consultancy owners and leaders over the last year;

• My industry research: various studies by companies like Grist and Source Global Research, 1,000+ articles from various experts, hundreds of podcasts, and hundreds of social media interactions with my followers (I publish daily on LinkedIn).

All of this information and data points allow me to not only keep my finger on the pulse of the industry but also notice patterns forming over time. And that’s what this yearly overview is about – patterns that boutique consultancy owners and leaders should be aware of and actively incorporate into their business thinking.

## 10 Consulting Trends Boutique Consultancies Must Keep in Mind in 2024

• Uncertainty will continue to dominate the market

• Clients will expect authoritative, authentic points of view from their consultancies more than ever before

• Consultancies that center their marketing around audience education will dominate in client acquisition

• Clients’ buying journey will be almost exclusively based on independent online research

• Positioning will make or break a consulting business

• Linear growth is out. Smart service design-based growth is in

• Consultancy owners may face well-being challenges in 2024

• Market challenges require disciplined internal alignment

• A challenging 2024 requires performance indicators 'at the fingertips'

• AI will continue to push consultancies with superficial expertise out of the market

## 1. Uncertainty will continue to dominate the market

We had 2 years of almost unlimited post-pandemic growth in consulting – in 2021 and 2022. I consider these two years to be ‘outlier years’ as they were not exactly a regular revenue growth continuation from the 2018-2019 years.

However, since late 2022, the consulting business has been facing economic uncertainty – brought about by fluctuations in the global economy, geopolitical tensions, and cost inflation (to name a few). Grist’s 2023 edition of its annualValue of B2B Thought Leadershipstudy reveals that 52% of decision-makers expect the economy to worsen (as opposed to only 29% that expect improvements).

Some of the most common challenges I have since noticed consultancies bring up in our conversations are: losing out on work due to reduced client budgets, project indecisiveness, and lack of consultancy revenue reliability. All of this indicates that clients’ budgets, needs and expectations have evolved rapidly, which, in turn, requires consultancies to be more agile, innovative, and client-centric than ever before.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• Consultancies that strive to deepen existing client relationships tend to have stronger financial stability. My consultancy clients were more keen than ever to forge closer relationships with their existing clients. This included regular check-ins, feedback sessions, educational interventions, open round table discussions, private webinars on hot topics (e.g. market trends, new tech), co-creating upcoming projects, and a pro-active client success program.

• Service design should accommodate deeper relationships with clients. There are many ways to extend a consultancy’s services to extend the engagement with clients and increase the value provided to them. For example, ongoing adoption monitoring, introducing subscription-based support models, vertical service integration, implementing managed services, strategic CXO guidance, platform or programmatic delivery (automation, monitoring, analysis,...), scheduled service reviews, ongoing data analysis & reporting, or budget planning support.

• Consultancy leaders could consider redefining client engagement entry points. I've assisted in several service entry-point redesigns to lower the decision-making bar for new clients. Here are some examples: developing (self) assessment tools for better initial engagement, the development of paid discovery services (e.g. feasibility study), simplification of client onboarding processes, or breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable parts to ease client decision-making.

## 2. Clients will expect authoritative, authentic points of view from their consultancies more than ever before

More than ever, B2B clients look to work with consultancies that they perceive as top experts.This is both my observation and is backed up by Grist’sstudy, according to which,60% of executives report an increase in their demand for thought leadership contentto support their business.50% attest to the critical importance of such content in their decision-making process when selecting an advisor.

Consultancies that will continue to win the battles for the budgets of these prospects are the ones that create authoritative, highly educational content that addresses the most pressing pain points of prospects.Consultancies that are not expanding their reputational footprint through a thought leadership strategy are not likely to be considered for transformational projects.Here are a few pieces of research data that should both scare and inspire consultancy leaders:

• 73% of executives say theywill look at competitorsif their advisory company is not producing thought leadership content

• 60% of executives report increaseddemand for thought leadership contentto support their business.

• 50% attest to thecritical importance of such content in their decision-making processwhen selecting an advisor.

This shows both the opportunity for boutique consultancies to stand out and the risks they will face if they don’t prioritize thought leadership.So what are decision-makers looking for in thought leadership pieces? According to Grist’s study:

• 51% want action-oriented content that helps make more informed decisions

• 50% want content that shows fresh thinking and explores new or different perspectives

• 48% want authentic content that puts existing expertise into practice.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• I urge consultancy leaders to rethink their approach to LinkedIn. 95% of consultancy owners have nothing to say. Their LinkedIn is ‘empty’. Growing a consultancy business is rooted in educating the target audience. And for those consultancy owners and leaders who think they can get away with doing a few quick and dirty chatGPT posts – welcome to the noise! This type of content will never accomplish meaningful results.

• It’s time to stop appointing partners without a voice. A silent majority is rising to power, a cohort of newly appointed partners who, perplexingly, have no discernible voice in their market. Their LinkedIn profiles are eerily quiet, their expertise domains, if detectable, are not connected to any leading voice, and their authority seems invisible to the naked eye.I encourage consultancies to instead foster the growth of real champions in 2024 – someone who not only possesses deep expertise in their know-how domain, industry, or market but also actively contributes to the discourse, influences trends and shapes the future of their field. These are the experts that clients want to work with. These are the leading thinkers who get invited by prospects and can deliver a steady flow of premium-fee projects.

• It's worth for consultancy leaders to get strategic about creating thought leadership content. Not every piece of content a consulting leader puts out is thought leadership. And not every piece of thought leadership delivers equal results. Education-driven authoritative content can be a powerful business development tool IF it is thought-out and consistent. It requires a strategy. Based on the many success stories I’ve witnessed from high-performing consultancies, as well as based on my own experience, winning audience education and prospects activation strategies are based on a gradual, 4-step thought leadership journey:Step 1: Inspiring the audience through awareness content. At this initial stage, consultancies' goal is to maximize the level of market awareness of their expertise. In practice, this means producing thought leadership content that gets the target audience’s attention.Step 2: Educating the audience through demand content. Once a consultancy acquires some regular readers through its inspirational content in Step 1 and builds that initial level of trust from the audience, it’s time to back up the transformational potential of content pieces with practical suggestions. Thought leadership pieces at this stage should offer problem-resolution advice.Step 3: Motivating the audience through conversion content. Thought leadership pieces at this stage show the risk/cost of inaction. They make a strong business case for investing. They show why deep expertise within a certain field is required to address the most crucial pain points of the target audience.Step 4: Activating the audience through onboarding content. This is the ultimate step – signing up prospects. Thought leadership pieces that will deliver stronger results are the ones that make it easy to get started and help reduce the fear of failure.

## 3. Consultancies that center their marketing around audience education will dominate in client acquisition

Sales and marketing success is a side effect of education-driven expertise sharing done right. “What? A side effect? Luk, are you kidding?” a boutique consultancy owner told me during a project sprint.

I am not kidding. Sales is not what consultancies should strive to do “on top”. Rather, they should aim to reach a stage where consistent high-value sales are just a side effect of doing education-driven marketing extremely well.I believe that marketing in a consulting business should be circular. Blog posts on the consultancy’s page can be broken down into smaller pieces of actionable advice on LinkedIn. The response rate and engagements on LinkedIn can be used to inform the thought leader and marketers what resonates with the target audience and why. This is then used to dive deeper into certain topics.The content that is shared and re-shared through channels that have the highest concentration of the target audience will have the most impact. I encourage consultancies to also incorporate sharing expertise through guest posts and guest appearances at online and offline events (e.g., podcasts) into the marketing strategy. Feedback from those guest engagements can then be utilized for future content.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• I strongly encourage consultancy owners and leaders to engage in conversations with the target audience and set up feedback loops. So much marketing that I come across from my clients and my target audience, in general, feels stale. There is no conversation. No valuable engagement. One of the main reasons I love LinkedIn so much is that, for me, it’s a live conference room. I use it to be constantly plugged into the conversation within my niche. I source feedback, I engage with the posts of others, and I incorporate feedback into my content strategy.

• Marketing efforts will deliver exponentially stronger results if consultancy owners and leaders are the main drivers of marketing activities. I’ve seen it with the consultancies I’ve assessed in 2023. Their marketing executive makes a few meaningless posts (because they are disconnected from the problem-resolution expertise), put out a report on engagement, tracks metrics, and make a few tweaks, and that’s about as far as it gets. Consultancy owners are minimally involved or not at all. Individual consultants and consulting leaders contribute the bare minimum. Education-driven marketing will never work in 2024 without the heavy involvement of the top voices and experts of the consultancy – its leaders and owners.

• Consultancy owners and leaders that are generous about knowledge-sharing will stand out. Generously sharing my knowledge has been the key to my consultancy's success. There are a ton of reasons why I advocate that boutique consultancies make education-driven marketing their priority. Here are just a few:Educating the target audience is the best possible way to build a strong and credible reputation as a consultancy. Without trust in their expertise, consulting firms won’t get that call to meet.Content builds visibility. As Google’sSEO Starter Guideputs it, “Creating compelling and useful content will likely influence your website more than any of the other factors discussed here.”The more a consultancy writes about how THEY have solved the problems of their clients - backed up with research and data - the more clients will relate to them and build a mental connection with them over time.There's no better way for consulting firms to deepen their expertise than writing about it, sharing it and stimulating discussion.And here’s the biggest reason of all – clients want to work with leaders. Nothing communicates leadership better than being generous with sharing knowledge!

• Marketing efforts are enhanced with a value-driven email strategy. Despite all sorts of new marketing channels popping up over the years, email remains unchallenged in its effectiveness. Even in 2024. Not only is email cost-effective, but it’s the ultimate trust weapon for consultancies. When a prospect reads a piece of thought leadership content and feels compelled to sign up for the newsletter, that’s a massive green flag that consultancies should pay attention to.I urge consultancies to treat this trust with utmost care. Consultancies should strive to deepen the relationship with this prospect by identifying other value-driven resources that they can provide him/her with.

## 4. Clients’ buying journey will be almost exclusively based on independent online research

Business development has been shifting from network-first to digitally-driven approaches for years now.Gone are the days when most new consulting businesses got won by taking prospects out for dinner. In 2024, just like in 2023, it’s all about showcasing deep expertise by demonstrating an outstanding level of understanding of buyers’ pain points and the consultancy’s ability to resolve these pain points at scale.Cold pitching in consulting has close to zero effect. At least as far as the prospects’ expectations go. Nobody wants to be called up out of nowhere, in the middle of the daily hassle and offered a bunch of services the prospect may or may not need.We are in 2024! Prospects do their own research on how their problems might get solved when determining which consultancies to reach out to or to invite to bid.Furthermore, cold pitching is simply a waste of resources. Most buyers are looking for partners they can trust. And trust can’t be built during a cold pitch. Forget it. You don't like those calls yourself, as a consultancy owner. So don't do it, even if you are under revenue pressure.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

Buyers do their homework, so consultancies should too.

I always remind consultancies of the 90-80 rule. 90 out of 100 service buyers will actively do their own research on a consultancy and its consultants. Unfortunately, 80 out of 100 firms automatically get rejected because their digital footprint does not point to a desired level of expertise and/or problem-resolution case.

Where are the clients searching? In short – anywhere and everywhere:

• They Google prospective consultancies and consultants to get a better understanding of their expertise;

• They Google questions related to their pain points and read authoritative content on the subject;

• They receive emails and WhatsApp messages from colleagues and other network members with links to interesting articles/studies/newsletters produced by consultancies. Also known as the 'dark social', it is a massive source of referral traffic.Some studiessuggest it may account for 84% of referral traffic;

• They listen to presentations at conferences;

• They attend webinars and listen to podcasts;

• The consult Gartner-type comparisons posts;

• They look up consultancies and individual consultants on LinkedIn; and

• They source recommendations in-person and via social media platforms like LinkedIn.

Consultancies that neglect the need to meet buyers where they are at – the digital? Well, they will struggle to get out of the vicious downward spiral, always trying to play catch-up, desperately offering discounts, cold-calling prospects, and struggling to build a reliable pipeline of work.

I urge consultancies to become acutely aware of what their digital presence – or lack thereof – tells their target audience: does it help prospects understand the depth and relevance of the firm’s expertise and/or does it encourage prospects to continue reading/listening/watching the advice or makes them close the tab in 5 seconds?

## 5. Positioning will make or break a consulting business

95% of potential consulting projectsdon’t make it out the client’s door, and with all the digital noise in 2024, things will get more difficult.We know there is enormous demand for external expertise. For example, according to areportfrom Allied Market Research, the global market for management consulting services will reach more than $800 billion by 2031, up from $300 billion in 2021.So what’s going on?Increasingly, consultancies that beat out their competitors are the ones that differentiate themselves through laser-sharp positioning.The 2024 consulting market is just too crowded with generic noise for consultancies that do not have a differentiating positioning to succeed. Buyers are bombarded with these generic messages – the “We serve at the intersection of digital transformation and client excellence” types of meaningless statements – that they just phase out 99% of it.I’ve worked with consultancies in the past few years that boast gross margins as high as 80%! For most consultancies, this seems like something out of a fairy tale – it just doesn’t happen, right?Except it does. I’ve seen the numbers.While these consultancies have a mix of drivers that enable them to achieve such levels of success, with almost no exception, they all excel in the following three aspects:

• Narrow expertise focus, deep specialisation, crystal clear value proposition;

• Repetition of similar projects (process standardization, uniform data gathering, reducing variability in project management)

• Pattern recognition & project outcomes prediction

Specificity is at the center of their way of thinking and performing. The leaders of these consultancies set up a very limited number of services in a way that allows them to maintain a narrow focus. They are the go-to experts in a very specific field.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• Consultancies that make value proposition design a priority are more likely to succeed. Whether it’s creating one from scratch or reevaluating and redesigning an existing one, value proposition design is a mandatory exercise.Value proposition design is one of the most crucial aspects of establishing the growth parameters of a consultancy. It impacts everything: how the consultancy is perceived in the market, how it pitches its services, how it is managed internally, what types of clients it takes on, and what kind of prospects to confidently say no to. It’s a compass that consultancy owners use in their decision-making.

• Consultancies could consider narrowing down who they help and how they help. If a patient requires open-heart surgery, given the choice, who do you think this patient would pick to perform the surgery: a cardiac surgeon who spent the last 20 years performing this and similar surgeries every day or a general surgeon?This is what clients also want – someone who can deliver outstanding results because of their incredible depth of expertise. That’s why it’s time for consultancies to narrow down their target market (who they help) and their services (what they solve and how they help). And that time is now. Because the results are not going to be instant.

• Using laser-sharp positioning, I recommend that consultancies try to standardize and productize their services. Standardization and productization are the backbone of efficiency. “But Luk, you can’t standardize consulting services – each client’s needs are unique!” I’ve heard this oh so many times. Here’s the thing – the challenges clients face are not unique. Sure, there is slight variation as it depends on the specific context of the client. However, years of in-depth analysis revealed to me that most hurdles in their business journeys are mere variations of common themes. So why should boutique consultancies bend over backwards to create fully tailored solutions? Leave that to the big consulting firms with infinite resources.More than ever before, in 2024, I believe that clients are (much) better served when the consultancy has the expertise and depth that allows them to productize and standardize services. The ability to do so speaks to the consultancy’s repetition of projects, which, as I already covered earlier, means the ability to spot patterns and deliver transformational, predictable outcomes.

Is the client telling they need a fully customized approach? Consultancies should consider telling these clients that they have a proven methodology and process that they will tailor to the client's context. Unless a boutique consultancy can get 2x or 3x the market rates, it's best to carefully think of accepting customized projects. If not, narrowing down and building proven methodologies/processes is a strong way forward.

## 6. Linear growth is out. Smart service design-based growth is in

The linear growth model is one where revenue growth is directly proportional to headcount growth.It’s the traditional consulting growth model that, in the 2024 reality, has become an unsustainable relic for small and mid-sized consultancies. There are two main reasons for that:

• Hiring top-tier talent has become extremely difficult.Especially these days, when so many firms are taking advantage of hiring remotely. Recruiting and retaining the right consulting experts is no easy task for consultancies that do not have a strong reputational footprint in a niche field.

• Profitability challenges.Linear growth also challenges profitability for boutique consultancies. Scaling operations to match revenue directly increases people cost before these investments yield financial returns, leading to diminishing profitability. A linear growth model necessitates higher rates to sustain margins, a tough ask in an extremely competitive and economically strained 2024.

I’ve spoken to several consultancies who underwent the painful exercise of rightsizing their staff in 2023. They simply didn’t have enough projects to justify having teams in those sizes. Their revenue plateaued or decreased in 2023, but the hiring and staffing were still based on the golden consulting years 2021-2022. Their profit projections didn't look good.On the other hand, some of the most successful boutique consultancies that I’ve talked to in 2023 were the ones who paid special attention to their service design. They grew through, e.g. vertical service integration (see further), one of the most powerful methodologies to avoid the ‘hire to scale’ battle.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• I discourage consultancies from thoughtless service diversification and trying to repair legacy services debt. It's a common phenomenon: boutique consultancies are often tempted to add new services to their portfolio continuously. Service diversification comes with two major risks: (1) it dilutes the positioning of a consultancy, and (2) it takes 2-3 years for a new service offering to mature.In my experience, a lot of the diversification hassle in consultancies is legacy debt because the owners kept adding new services in the past because they believed in ‘more services = more money’ OR the owners couldn’t agree on the expertise direction amongst each other, so they ended up with ‘a little bit for everybody’.Improving the non-linear growth capacity? Time to trim the service offerings that are bringing the entire consultancy's efficiency down and focus on the core competencies.

• Service and client journey design is a foundational, strategic activity to improve non-linear growth. Service and client journey design is a strategic exercise. How a consultancy maps out various interactions with prospects and clients and the (standardized) methodologies it establishes through service and client journey design can make or break a consultancy's non-linearity. I worked with a sales forecasting boutique consultancy. They doubled the revenue in 2021 with only a 15% headcount increase. The reason? Vertically integrated service design, allowing to grow without adding a lot of new people (see their case study in the article about vertical integration in the recommended reading list, below).

## 7. Consultancy owners may face well-being challenges in 2024

As mentioned earlier, 2023 was a tough year for many consultancies (see Trend #1). A large percentage of consultancy owners that I spoke to in 2023 reported feeling overwhelmed. They are finding themselves sucked into the never-ending spin of daily hassles, constantly under pressure to keep the business afloat and growing, especially in light of the challenges that 2023 has brought.It saddened me just how many boutique consultancy owners confided that their quality of life was poor.A common denominator I found in many of these conversations is that most of these struggling founders have created 'the founder-dependent consultancy'.

As a result, two, three, or even five years down the line, they still find themselves managing the daily grind instead of working on the strategic priorities of the business. And they feel they can't win this battle, they don’t know a viable way forward. And the 2023 (and going forward in 2024) economic uncertainty that I discussed earlier sure doesn’t help ease the pressure.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

• Consultancy owners will continue to struggle unless they create and execute a strategy for reclaiming their quality of life.In my journey as a performance advisor to boutique consultancies, I've seen it all too often: brilliant minds and gifted consultancy owners being totally consumed by the very businesses they've built. The allure of chasing every opportunity, the thrill of diverse projects, and the pressure to satisfy an ever-growing roster of clients can be intoxicating. But at what cost? At the cost of their own mental and psychological well-being.It's a trap many fall into and a painful one. My advice to boutique consultancy owners is twofold:Recognize the trap. It’s crucial to understand what habits and mindsets are leading to these patterns.Next is to embrace a narrow consultancy positioning. This is one of my most important messages to consultancies that I bring up often: deep expertise in a narrow field is a boutique consultancy’s superpower. Focusing on what the consultancy does best allows its founders, leaders, and consultants to develop deep expertise, differentiate their value, command premium pricing, and ultimately improve their quality of life. It’s not about working less. It's about working smarter.

• Consultancy owners that eliminate their egos from the decision-making process will be able to rip the rewards. The ego is the enemy. Now, a healthy amount of ego is good. In fact, when in the form of confidence it's often the prerequisite to building and growing successful consultancies, especially in the hypercompetitive 2024 consulting world. However, confidence should never cross into the territory of arrogance.I believe that egos in consultancies must always be kept in check. Instead, decisions should be made based on: data, target audience’s feedback, internal feedback, long-term vision, and feedback from external advisors and mentors.

• Recognize the trap. It’s crucial to understand what habits and mindsets are leading to these patterns.

• Next is to embrace a narrow consultancy positioning. This is one of my most important messages to consultancies that I bring up often: deep expertise in a narrow field is a boutique consultancy’s superpower.

It’s not about working less. It's about working smarter.

## 8. Market challenges require disciplined internal alignment

Throughout my years advising consultancy owners, I've observed this recurring theme that threatens the long-term sustainability of boutique consultancy businesses: I call it 'the illusion of internal alignment'.In the meeting room, agreements are made, nods are shared, and a sense of unified direction amongst the owners is seemingly reached. However, once the meeting ends, each owner often reverts to their individual path, driven by their own interpretation of the strategy, leading to disjointed actions that dilute the consultancy's coherence and impact.

The 2023 market difficulties caused many of the consultancy ownership/partner groups to make difficult decisions, putting the internal alignment under severe pressure. Leadershad different fictions of their 2023 struggles and were sometimes pretty brutally out of alignment. I've been in the middle of several such troublesome meetings.This lack of genuine internal alignment among owners doesn't only limit growth and undermine stability; it poses a serious risk to team morale and cohesion. And it’s not only an internal concern; it's a stain that might also bleed outward, tainting a consultancy's reliability.Whether it’s due to ego-driven decision-making of leaders or because they never made an effort to truly get on the same page, I urge consultancy owners to face the problem and get rid of 'the illusion of internal alignment'.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

I recommend doing two things in 2024 to avoid owner/partner misalignment.

• Create a crystal clear value proposition & connected servicesConsultancies will benefit from going back to the drawing board on the foundational elements. Here, I’m talking about two foundational elements: value proposition and service offering design. Until all partners/owners fully agree on a unified deep-expertise-based value proposition and then strategically design services around this deep expertise, nothing else will matter.

• Make internal alignment a KPIEnsuring internal alignment is not a one-time exercise. It should be made a key priority, and consultancy owners and leaders need to sit down and review the alignment once a quarter. And why not give a score on their alignment and openly discuss it? External guidance and moderation during such alignment meetings could greatly benefit boutique consultancies as the expert outside perspective will help protect against tunnel vision.

## 9. A challenging 2024 requires performance indicators at the fingertips

There are dozens of KPIs that consultancy owners could keep track of to get a picture of how their business is performing.

Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that too often, consultancy leaders either over-track (and get lost) or stop at a few basic KPIs and don’t worry about the rest. Too much or not enough.

A recent Deltek study in Europe reported that 60% of professional service firms didn't really use KPIs to manage their business. I was flabbergasted. A challenging economy requires greater agility, which involves having the core performance indicators 'at the fingertips’, as I always say.

Unfortunately, consultancy performance is often assessed solely through financial metrics, primarily the P&L statement (from the books from 2 months ago?). However, this traditional P&L approach has serious limitations as it relies on lagging indicators and overlooks critical consulting-specific aspects that define excellence.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

Here's what I advise consultancies as the absolute minimum to track and measure. Yes, this is a somewhat uncommon way of tracking and explaining. Why uncommon? Because I look at tracking from the backside: what is it that we need to do to achieve a better performance?

• We need new clients coming to us (instead of chasing new clients)

• We need to retain and develop those clients over an extended period (instead of one-off projects)

• We need to create stable and reliable revenue (growth), uncoupled from headcount growth (non-linear growth)

• We need strong margins to enable investments in thought leadership, new methodologies & technology, and people training

• We need to attract and retain key players to create stability and deepen the expertise of the consultancy

I get that question all the time: "what should we track then? Here's what I would track...

1. Revenue (Rev)

• Rev total, per client, per project, per service, and trend lines

• Client concentration risk analysis (a few big clients)

• Rev per FTE (indicator for business development capacity & pricing, productivity, service design, and utilisation)

• Revenue reliability (forecast gap analysis, which is both a pipeline quality and pipeline management evaluation)

30% of annual revenue coming from new clients to fuel growth via an inbound motion, leading to:

• low CAC (cost of acquisition) <5%

• high win rates per proposal >70%

• short sales cycles (to be defined)

• bigger average deal size (to be defined)

• improved pricing levels (clients came to the consultancy, they tend to accept higher pricing levels)

70% of annual revenue coming from developing existing clients to create long-term stability:

• strong client retention >3 yr (see

• high lifetime value (total lifetime revenue/margin)

• first-class project/client satisfaction (not via NPS but via client interview)

• per client, per project, per service, total, pre & post project measurement

• project success: on time, on budget, on scope, outcomes achieved

4. Key player attraction & retention

There's a lot you can do here - yes, I've been a CHRO :-). But this is what I would focus on:

• employee engagement and satisfaction: I would never do an annual survey, but I would get people together on a quarterly basis and have open discussions in combination with a quarterly score that can give that includes the leadership alignment score (see Trend #8)

• depending on how big the boutique consultancy is, I would always track retention and have a personal meeting when people are leaving (and wish them all the best, and keep them in an alumni 'something' (a community, a meetup, an annual conference,...)

## 10. AI will continue to push consultancies with superficial expertise out of the market

So many industries panicked in 2023 with the massive releases of generative AI-based products. The consulting business is no exception. What does it mean for the future of consulting?Generative AI is a highly useful tool. It can improve productivity, help automate many tedious processes, etc. However, it also places even more emphasis on deep expertise. Clients are going to increasingly look for consultancies to help with transformational projects. That’s something AI can’t replicate.Many of the services offered by generalist consultants, on the other hand, are under existential threat.

But let's also be honest, we don't really know yet what the full impact of AI will be in the coming years, both internally as well as externally (clients). In any case, there's no other way thanto stay vigilant, adapt, and leverage AI's potential wisely as we move forward into the unknown.

### What consultancies can do in 2024

Here is a useful visual representation I came across in Andrew Rogerson'sarticle on how professional services firms can leverage AI.

I see two main avenues for AI integration in the consulting business:

• Embracing AI internally to improve productivity. According to aDeloitte survey, 74% of organizations reported that AI technologies helped them accelerate data analysis processes. AI tools offer incredible opportunities for consultancies. They can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on repetitive processes, maximizing the efficiency of consultancies and freeing up more time for value-driven client work.However, only consultancies that are very specific about their target audience, the types of pain points they solve for that audience, and a proven methodology will be able to take full advantage of the potential of AI. Why? Because these are the consultancies that have repetitive processes, centralized and consistent data collection, and consistent delivery methods.

• Integrating AI into consultancies' external offering in a meaningful way. Here’s the thing – everyone wants to benefit from AI these days. The hype in 2023 was so massive that many clients are starting to feel that if they are not integrating AI into their daily operations, they are missing out.Yes, there are massive improvement opportunities offered by AI-enabled tools and approaches. I encourage consultancies to start thinking about integrating AI into their offerings. However, they need to find a balance between satisfying the clients’ - sometimes thoughtless - demands for AI products/approaches and offering something that actually is of strong value (as opposed to having an AI offering just because it is “trendy”).

## In conclusion

Yes, 2023 was a challenging year. It took a toll on many consultancy leaders and boutique consultancy owners. I don't expect market conditions to change drastically in 2024.

However, I don't believe this to be bad news. The demand for expert consulting services is high. Clients desperately want experts with a strong depth of knowledge to come in and help them tackle important pain points. The market is there. The demand is there. What changed is the client's expectations. Their purchasing journey, too, continues to evolve.

Therefore, there is a sea of opportunities for boutique consultancies that understand and embrace those changes, that are able to meet prospects where they are, and that can showcase their deep expertise and the transformational results of their work.

2024 is an opportunity for consultancies to infuse their business with both resilience and agility through smarter service design, laser-sharp positioning, and non-linear growth models.

I'd like to invite all boutique consultancies to join me for a virtual briefing session. In the session, I will walk the participants through the trends I explain here, open the floor to discussion to exchange experiences and best practices, and provide further actionable recommendations.

# As A Consultancy Owner, You Always Attract What You Are, Not What You Want

This article was last updated on 8 January 2024.

The consulting industry had 2 years of almost unlimited post-pandemic growth in 2021 and 2022. These were, in fact, ‘outlier years’ and not a regular revenue growth continuation from 2018-2019.

However, from late 2022 to early 2023, economic uncertainty hit the consulting business heavily, caused by fluctuations in the global economy, geopolitical tensions, and cost inflation (to name a few).

This has presented severe challenges for most consultancies: reduced client budgets, project indecisiveness, and lack of consultancy revenue reliability.

Clients’ budgets, needs and expectations have evolved rapidly, requiring consultancies to be more agile, innovative, and client-centric than ever before.

While change is inevitable and often good,I've spoken to many boutique consultancy owners who report just how big of a negative impact 2023 has had on their well-being.

Lots of consultancy owners believe they’re in constant competition with everyone else. Thus, they always try to reinvent the wheel, change their strategy, and keep all options open instead of being trustworthy in a particular expertise domain.

As a result, they work too many hours, try to please everyone, and feel overwhelmed and stressed out. They’re so afraid of losing potential clients that they try to sayyesto every opportunity. It's my everyday experience working with these owner-led boutique consultancies (the consulting firms I advise).

The problem is that trying to put your eggs in everybody’s basket is ineffective and tiring.

And if you’re constantly chasing, always trying to find the next opportunity or client, you’ll inevitably attract more of that stressful routine into your life and consultancy business.

> "Here’s the unpopular truth: being a successful consultancy owner doesn’t need to be hard. You don’t need to work 10+ hours per day, seven days per week. And most importantly, you need to understand that your work as a consultant is not your life."

"Here’s the unpopular truth: being a successful consultancy owner doesn’t need to be hard. You don’t need to work 10+ hours per day, seven days per week. And most importantly, you need to understand that your work as a consultant is not your life."

There’s so much more to a good life than professional success. However, you can also have both: Enjoy quality time with your loved ones, make time for your favourite activities, and run a healthy and profitable consulting business. And when I say "run a business", I mean workingonthis business instead ofinit. That is, working on the strategic goals, conducting assessments, and designing long-term strategies instead of managing the daily grind.

All of this is possible if you know exactly what you want and are crystal clear about the value your consultancy can bring.

> "But as always, the biggest challenge is not strategic - it’s in our minds. I've learned that the hard way."

"But as always, the biggest challenge is not strategic - it’s in our minds. I've learned that the hard way."

Working on yourself is the most underrated way to grow your consulting business. Most people don’t understand that their professional results and income can’t outgrow their personalities.

Investing in yourself always pays the highest dividends, and working on yourself will lead to positive changes in your life - not only in your work as a consultancy owner but also beyond that. But most importantly, it’ll help you be aware of your priorities and use your time and energy accordingly.

## Here's what I learned.

I understand the temptation of saying yes to every opportunity that knocks on your door, the thrill of pursuing diverse projects, and the drive to satisfy an ever-growing roster of clients.

I've been there in my early consulting years, trapped in the all-consuming whirlwind of my boutique consultancy, perpetually chasing my tail to maximise revenue and extend my reach.

The result? A high degree of depletion, compromised work quality, and diminishing quality of life. A burnout stormed into my life.

It felt like I was caught in an endless loop of work with no room for myself, all the while forgetting why I started my consultancy to begin with. However, I decided to rewrite this narrative.

I shifted my strategy, honed my focus, and started saying no to distractions, allowing me to rekindle my passion for the work, reclaim my personal life, and drastically improve my service quality.

Now, many years later, I enjoy a sense of fulfilment and balance I never thought possible. You can do it, too - there's a better way to run your consultancy.

## Stop chasing. Focus on your zone of genius instead.

No matter how experienced they are, way too many boutique consultancy owners I meet live and work in a constant doom loop.

They’re always busy chasing their tail to find new clients and projects. They worry about finding the next one once they win the next client or project.

This constant path of chasing leads to a few serious problems:

• They’re unable to focus on their zone of genius because they sayyesto every opportunity, even if it’s not lucrative or they don’t have the necessary know-how to solve a specific problem;

• They struggle to become a well-known authority in their market because they lacktimeto establish and communicate their expertise;

• They must deal with clients and projects that don’t always fit their strengths, leading to frustration for both parties;

• They’re constantly stressed and worried.

## You won’t get what you want unless you are what you want.

That sounds like a difficult sentence, right? Let me explain.

If you want clarity, you need to take time to get clear about what you want. This might sound obvious, but for most people, it’s not.

Most consultancy owners attract confusion, long workdays, and tiring clients because that’s how theyfeel. They expect their job to be difficult, so they receive that.

They want an easier life but don’t even believe it’s possible. Instead, they think that being successful in business needs to be complicated. They believe feeling exhausted and stressed is normal.

But this couldn’t be further from the truth.

> "It doesn’t matter what you think you want and it doesn’t matter what you do because you only create in life what you are". (Jim Fortin)

"It doesn’t matter what you think you want and it doesn’t matter what you do because you only create in life what you are". (Jim Fortin)

The overall consulting market is still attractive despite the slowdown of 2023. But that market - more than ever before - is also crowded, noisy, and challenging. Most consultancies seem to forget they must stand out from the crowd to succeed.

Most are easily replaceable because they don’t have deep expertise to solve high-value client problems. They might get hired because of their pricing, not because they’re the best in their field.

To create a different reality in your life and career, you must be clear about what you want.

Even though it might first sound like a waste of time, thinking about the bigger picture and maximising the value delivered to a narrow audience are the two most rewarding and effective tasks you can complete.

Once you have clarity and purpose, you’ll attract more of that. You’ll pull clients who want to work with you because they believe you fit their values. Additionally, they’ll also appreciate your expertise.

On top of that, you’ll be able to complete profitable and rewarding projects without working yourself to death. You can avoid managing daily tasks and spend more time workingonthe business.

## Say no to the good to say yes to the great.

Learning to saynoisn’t easy, but it’s necessary. Most of the time, sayingnoto the wrong opportunities and clients makes it easier to sayyesto the right ones.

Your goal as a consultancy owner should be to work fewer hoursinthe business, more hoursonthe business, and have lots of time to spend on other priorities in your life - whether that’s your family, a good cause, sports, or other hobbies.

By sayingyesto clients who don’t match your consultancy's skills, expertise, and expectations, you’re making it harder for everybody in the team to make time for the projects and activities you all genuinely enjoy.

> "With each wrong yes, you’ll attract more wrong opportunities."

"With each wrong yes, you’ll attract more wrong opportunities."

The two main reasons why sayingnois often difficult are our ego and fear of losing revenue (or income). Most consultancy owners believe that sayingnocould lead to a drop in revenue and profit, which is often hard to digest.

They don’t understand that having more time would help them attract ideal clients who’ll happily pay higher fees so they don't end up stuck with many projects that don’t fit their expertise and expectations.

Apart from that, their ego stands in their way because they view sayingnoas a sign of weakness. The truth, however, is that it’s a sign of precious strength.

If you can’t saynoto the wrong clients and projects, you’ll likely attract more of them and end up in a downward spiral of undercharging for your services and feeling overwhelmed by too much work without having financial stability.

Sayingnoto a client or opportunity doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means that you know exactly what you want and are unwilling to accept projects that don’t fit the consultancy's focus and positioning.

## How to close the gap and attract more of what you want.

At this point, you might ask yourself: “Well, okay, but how exactly do I become the type of person to attract the kind of outcomes I desire?!”

Here’s the answer: try to show up as the person living that reality daily.

You start by adjusting your way of thinking and acting so you slowly become that person who has all the things you want with your consultancy, e.g., authority in the market, a laser-sharp value proposition, high-paying clients, and a schedule that allows you to spend lots of time doing the things that light up your heart.

Ask yourself what you want and why you might not have it yet.

For example, if you want to work with clients who genuinely value the work of your consultancy and pay premium prices, ask yourself why you haven’t been able to attract them so far.

Maybe you’ve been too busy serving those underpaying clients to protect the consultancy's revenue. I get that. I've been there.

Maybe it’s because they never felt attracted to you. After all, they don’t really understand what you’re doing and why they should trust you.

Maybe because your prices are so low, they believe there must be something off with the value you deliver.

Maybe it's because by attempting to cater to a large audience, you diluted the expertise of your consultancy, and it's now time to get very specific about what problems you solve for what types of clients via what proven methodology.

If you want to create different results, you need to believe that you deserve them and show up as the person ready to welcome these outcomes.

> As Jim Rohn once famously said:“Success is something you attract by the person you become.”

As Jim Rohn once famously said:“Success is something you attract by the person you become.”

Stop chasing clients and projects. Instead, become a consultancy owner or leader confident in your abilities and skills and attract well-paying clients who genuinely value your work.

Your time is too precious to be wasted on serving underpaying customers and chasing projects that don’t fit your skills.

Once people understand your expertise and know why they should trust you, they’ll be drawn to you and your consultancy like a magnet.

Doing business and making money don’t need to be exhausting. They can result from being highly focused and sayingnoto all the things that don’t serve your goals.

More is often less, and avoiding time-wasters is the best strategy to have more time for essential things in life.

Be patient in the process. It took me a few years. You don’t always need to be ten steps ahead of anyone else. Take time to pause and breathe. Sometimes, short breaks can lead to the most significant breakthroughs anyway.

You attract what you are, not what you want.

# 150 Pieces of Advice I Shared with Consultancies on LinkedIn in 2023

We had two years of almost unlimited post-pandemic growth in consulting in 2021 & 2022. These were, in fact, ‘outlier years' and not really a regular revenue growth continuation from the 2018-2019 years.

Since late 2022, however, economic uncertainty has hit the consulting business quite heavily, caused primarily by fluctuations in the global economy, geopolitical tensions, and cost inflation (to name a few).

This has presented severe challenges for most consultancies: reduced client budgets, project indecisiveness, and lack of consultancy revenue reliability. In parallel, clients’ budgets, needs and expectations have evolved rapidly, requiring consultancies to be more agile, innovative, and client-centric than ever before.

Many of the consultancies I've worked with this year came to me because they were struggling to grow – or even maintain – their business. So I dedicated a lot of energy in 2023 to sharing advice and observations with my audience on how to organically grow consulting business in the times of uncertainty. Not just that – but how to use the changes in clients' and prospects' behavior that are caused by the uncertainty to turn a struggling consulting business into a high-performing one.

I make sure to share my learnings with my audience on LinkedIn. This is by far the most important platform for me. It's my live conference room. I use LinkedIn to not only share my advice and knowledge in bite-sized form, but to create a feedback loop with my audience of consultancies.

I read every comment, respond to requests for additional information, identify new topics to cover in my blog posts, take note of various perspectives, gauge the level of engagement for different topics that I post about, etc.

This is an invaluable exercise that allows me to remain constantly connected to my target audience – boutique consultancy owners and leaders. The engagement on LinkedIn helps me better understand their pain points, what their current challenges are, what they are prioritizing and why. It supplements the one-on-one conversations I have with clients and prospects.

I encourage consultancy leaders to use LinkedIn to stay close to their target audience. To stay engaged. To deepen their expertise.

# Moving Away From Early-Stage Characteristics as a Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 21 November 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/boutique-consultancies-moving-away-from-early-stage-characteristics

---

In my work with consultancies, one of the advantages I have is being an outsider. Often, boutique consultancy owners and consulting leaders are so entrenched in the hustle of daily operations that taking a step back to impartially review their business becomes a real challenge.

Having reviewed the performance of dozens of consultancies in the last few years and having advised investors/buyers in their vetting of boutique consultancies for potential acquisitions, I've noticed a critical trend.

One key realization is that many boutique consultancies, even those over 5-6 years old, often remain stuck in early-stage characteristics. This stagnation seriously hinders their evolution towards the maturity needed for sustained growth and profitability.

In this article, I will explain why stepping away from early-stage characteristics is vital for transitioning into a mature consulting business.

## The journey from early-stage to mature consultancy

Here is a typical story of how consultancies get started.A handful of talented partners come together. They usually have strong domain expertise. They come either from larger consulting firms or were previously corporate executives. They have a very strong sales drive and service-delivery mindset.Here is where often problems begin. After 2-3 early-stage years, these founders should be, in theory, starting to relinquish control over day-to-day operations. The consultancy should be at a point where its top leaders can gradually move toward more strategic tasks of running a business instead of managing the daily grind.Unfortunately, there are many consultancy owners that, even 5-6 years later, still find themselves overburdened with hundreds of operational tasks, which often leads to getting stuck in several ‘hard-to-get-rid-of’ early-stage characteristics.

*Recommended reading:How Boutique Consultancy Owners Can Reclaim Their Quality of Life*

### Early-stage consultancies share a mix of the following characteristics

• Positioning clarity and service validation challenges (service-market fit)

• Revenue and profit unreliability, with many ups and downs, causing instability in the consultancy and a tendency to accept non-fit clients or projects (to protect revenue - a vicious loop)

• No trust-building at scale – no case studies, client testimonials, social proof, or impactful reputational footprint

• A top-heavy structure (making the costs also top-heavy) – the first few hires tend to be senior-level consultants with strong backgrounds and expertise (an absolutely normal approach)

• Low-level infrastructure investments – CRM, project automation (PSA), financial reporting, etc. A lot of the work is ad hoc, going with the flow (supported by the Excel sheet)

• Lack of standardization of processes (efficiency) and productization of services (marketing), which doesn’t help the pitch narrative either (the narrative gets adjusted to the client or proposal)

• Due to the lack of standardized methodologies, there is also very little structured data gathering to study (and reduce) the variability and predictability of future project outcomes

• The quality of life of the founders/owners/leaders is challenging – they are overwhelmed with too many tasks

It is normal for these characteristics to be present in the first couple of years. However, if they remain beyond the early-stage years - 5-6 years into the journey – it most likely becomes a road to trouble.

## A helpful framework: the four consulting archetypes

In a recent articlefor PSA software vendor Deltek, I developed a consulting archetype visual representation to help consultancy owners identify where they are in their maturity journey.This is not a scientific study but my 'Experience Quadrant' – an attempt to create a thoughtfully constructed framework distilling years of my professional interactions and learnings into an accessible reference tool.The archetypes can help consultancy owners or leaders understand how to design their roles and responsibilities for future success.The core message in this ‘Experience Quadrant’ is the visual representation of moving away from early-stage characteristics toward a more mature business strategy.The move from ‘below the line’ (working IN the business) to ‘above the line’ (working ON the business).(‘the line’ is the dotted horizontal line, the split between Q1/Q2 and Q3/Q4)

### Overview of the quadrants

• Q1: Frontline dynamo– this person can be found deep in the project trenches, is very hands-on, operationally focused, and typically has very strong technical skills.

• Q2: Project vanguard– this is typically someone who strives for operational excellence, has limited involvement in sales, and is heavily involved in managing and leading projects. This archetype has an interest in project financials but lacks interest in the consolidated financials of the consultancy.

• Q3: Deal orchestrator– this is the rainmaker of the consultancy, a key accounts leader. These leaders are very intuitive about spotting opportunities. Typically, these are the ones who present at conferences, take client meetings, and connect with people. However, their financial monitoring is rather selective (sales only).

• Q4: Strategic architect– this is the strategic visionary type who delegates sales and operations. Those who fall in this archetype are business development-focused, are on top of the consolidated financials of the business, work on service offering design, and, of course, actively participate in team development and mentorship.

### Nobody falls into a single quadrant

It’s important to note that barely anyone falls precisely into a single quadrant. Almost every consulting leader and consultancy owner I mapped onto the quadrant has been a blend of two or more archetypes.

However, there appears to be a rather prominent split between:

• those who workinthe business (the lower two quadrantsbelow the dotted line), and

• those who workonthe business (the upper two quadrantsabove the dotted line).

That means most leaders either showcase a stronger Q3/Q4 ‘managerial blend’ or a stronger Q1/Q2 ‘operational blend’.Working IN the business and leaning more toward Q1 and Q2 is pretty natural in the early stages. The focus is onselling and delivering.However, over time, consultancy owners must make plans to turn their businesses into founder-independent consultancies and strive to switch to working mainly ON the business:managing and growing.Founder-independency is one of the signs of a mature business.Unfortunately, this deliberate and well-organized upward move does not always happen in consultancy firms. And it should.

### A few interesting statistics

Earlier this year, I mapped 162 of my consultancy owner clients and connections onto the quadrant.Once again, almost all showcased more than one tendency, so the numbers below represent which quadrant they have the strongest tendency toward:

• Q1, Frontline Dynamo:     26%

• Q2, Project Vanguard:     12%

• Q3, Deal Orchestrator:     44%

• Q4, Strategic Architect:   18%

Looking at it from a below/above-the-line perspective:

• Below the line (working more IN the business):     38%

• Above the line (working more ON the business):   62%

These people were all owners, founders, or partners in boutique consultancies:

• existing > 5 years

• with > 2M revenue (euro)

• and > 20 consultants

In my opinion - more than 5 years after the start - almost 40% of the owners/founders aren’t sufficiently working ON the business and are instead working too much IN the business.

This approx. 40% of ‘below-the-line leadership’ will likely struggle to reach the level of above-the-line maturity they need to manage and grow the consultancy. They risk getting stuck in a vicious loop of early-stage characteristics and unstable circumstances.Overall, I consider the leadership in these consultancies:

• Working too much IN the business

• Focusing too much on selling and delivering, not enough on managing and growing (working ON the business)

• Too much maintaining a founder-dependent environment

• Not having built enough foundations for further growth

## In conclusion

The journey of boutique and mid-sized consultancies is dynamic and marked by distinct stages and challenges.I've observed the common pitfalls that hinder their growth and maturity. My archetype ‘Experience Quadrant’, detailing the four consulting archetypes and the below/above-the-line split, can be a valuable methodology for boutique consultancy owners to identify where they currently stand in their leadership journey and where they need to steer their business for long-term success.It’s about understanding the strong connection between leaving behind early-stage characteristics and the need for consultancy leaders and owners to start spending more time working on the business instead of in the business.I encourage boutique consultancy owners to move ‘above the line’, working more ON the business and leaving the early-stage characteristics behind in a conscious and deliberate consultancy firm design.

# How I Share My Expertise with My Audience of Consultancy Owners

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 06 November 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-i-share-my-expertise-with-my-audience-of-consultancy-owners

---

I’ve been working four days per week since 2019. In the four business days of the week, I make calls with prospects, work with my clients, and spend at least one hour every day putting together my learnings into various forms of content.I know way too many consulting leaders who are constantly stressed about time management. What we discover upon initial conversations, in most cases, is that the lack of a proper time management strategy is not the underlying issue. It’s the priorities and the methods for going about these priorities.Consultancy owners and leaders spend too much time working in the business – especially regarding business development and project execution.Pitching and chasing prospects is a very time-consuming process. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s not for me. It never has been for me.My client recruitment strategy is rooted in educating my audience, sharing my expertise, building trust with prospects, and then discussing project parameters with qualified leads – consultancy owners who come to me with an inquiry, not the other way around.So, in this article, I wanted to share my strategy for audience education, engagement, and, ultimately, business development with my audience of boutique consultancy owners and leaders.I’m revealing all this information because it’s a straightforward process that is 100% replicable. I encourage consultancy owners to use this as a blueprint.

## What I share with my audience and my source of inspiration

What do I share with my audience? Everything!Of course, my work with clients remains confidential. But I share all of what I learned about the processes that work, strategies that deliver strong ROIs, etc.I openly discuss the common mistakes I see consultancies make and offer advice on how to remedy them. I share the roadmaps I’ve helped my clients set up to adjust their positioning. I explain why specific business strategies work (e.g.,vertical service integrations) and why others are doomed to fail (e.g.,growing through horizontal service expansion).

Sharing my expertise, knowledge, and learnings has always been an exercise of carving out my niche and building trust. I do not try to cater to a larger audience. I am not interested in writing about topics I have superficial knowledge of. I am laser-focused on providing value to a narrow audience within a narrow subject.Does every reader/follower/subscriber become a client? No, of course not. However, every single client I’ve worked with in the last few years has reached out to me because they think my expertise is well-positioned to help them tackle particular problem areas.Recommended reading:Business Development In Consulting Is Rooted In Educating Your Audience

### Where I source my topic ideas

“Luk, what do I write about?”

I’ve heard this question more than once. My answer is: ‘Your area of expertise is the subject you know most about and can provide the most value to your audience.’ It’s really that simple.I source my topic ideas from my daily interactions and work with boutique consultancies.

• Had a call with a prospect? I jot down the pain points they brought up, their biggest challenge in running the business, their current strategies, and so on.

• Made a post on LinkedIn? I take note of the comments, the questions that arise, the feedback, and new perspectives.

• Completed a client project? I gather and review the data for patterns from my assessments and KPI analysis. I also summarize my learnings – how I helped, what new information I learned that allows me to deepen my expertise, what challenges we prioritized addressing, what the end result of this client engagement was, and more.

• Someone responded to my newsletterwith a request to clarify my point of view. I instantly add it to my long document of content ideas.

My daily interactions with my audience - both off- and online - are of utmost importance because they allow me to put together posts not in a vacuum but by actively listening to my readers.This helps me ensure that my expertise-sharing time is well-spent: my content is relevant and provides my target audience with value.Every single boutique consultancy owner can do the same. It’s not rocket science.

## Content formats that work for me

My three main platforms for sharing my expertise are:

• My blog

• LinkedIn

• My newsletter

I love to get involved outside of these three channels. I frequently accept invitations to join webinars, podcasts, guest authorships, etc.Recommended podcast episode:unbillable hours’ episode Productizing Services– I discuss what productization means for consultancies

However, the three platforms I listed are where I put 90% of my energy when creating educational content.So, I will dive deeper into why these three channels work for me and how they help me continuously grow my reputational footprint and, ultimately, generate new business.

### The Visible Authority blog

My blog is my largest repository of the knowledge I share with my audience. I tend to go into detail when covering a subject and posting it on my blog.I aim to provide as much depth as possible in my posts – within the bounds of reason, of course (who has the time to spend 2 hours reading an article!).I get, on average, 3,600-4,000 monthly reads – around 1,000 of those are through organic traffic.The average time a user spends reading my posts is 3,5 - 4 minutes (according to global statistics, the average time users spend on a website is45-54 secondsin 2023!). Between 2% and 3% of blog visits convert to newsletter subscriptions.I make sure to write new articles twice a month as a bare minimum.However, like any database, my knowledge database, too, requires regular maintenance and upgrades. That’s why I spend time reviewing my older posts every quarter, determining what could use a refresh, analyzing which posts should be split into a separate post, etc.As my service offering evolves, so does my blog.Over time, I was able to build up enough authoritative content within a narrow focus area that I now generate most of my traffic through organic search.

Below are a few examples of searches consultancy owners enter into Google and come across my content – usually on Page 1 of search results.

Of course, I am very mindful of the importance of SEO. However, I never dedicated more time to it than covering my basics: valuable content above all, and making sure I have elements like an attractive title, meta tags for each article, removing dead links from older blog articles, etc.Beyond that, it has never been a matter of ensuring specific keywords appear evenly throughout H2 and H3 headers, sending out requests for backlinks, and other SEO strategies.Yet, I get returning visitors because what I write resonates with a specific audience (⅓).My content gets linked to other sources. It generates engagement on social media platforms. I regularly update older posts to keep them relevant. These are all signals that Google considers when determining the ranking of websites.As a result, my educational pieces get discovered by consultancy owners and leaders from outside my immediate readership base.Often, these users turn into frequent readers. Many subscribe to my newsletter. Others connect with me on LinkedIn.Over time, this creates a natural funnel of prospects who, upon getting familiar with what I do, how I do it, and my point of view, reach out to me with a collaboration inquiry.

### My LinkedIn network

My business is B2B. I work with boutique consultancies. Where do I find them in large numbers? On the most prominent professional network in the world – LinkedIn.I’m not particularly invested in other social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter, or anything in-between.While I probably could generate a few leads from those, I prefer to put my efforts into one platform that has my target audience’s attention than try to disperse my efforts.As a result, I now have 10,000+ followers on LinkedIn (from 5,000 in 2021).

Most consultancy owners/partners totally misunderstand LinkedIn.They are stuck in archaic thinking about LinkedIn, treating it as a bulletin board for self-promotion or as a picture diary of all sorts of events.These consultancy owners and leaders are missing the point of social engagement for business growth.While they muse over the pictures of their fabulous keynote presentation from last week (that doesn’t drive real engagement), their LinkedIn-savvy competitors are engaging in real-time with clients and prospects, learning directly from the market through immediate feedback on their shared viewpoints, on-the-spot sharpening their thinking with each interaction.I urge consultancies to embrace the power of instant feedback loops — how a single post can trigger insightful discussions becomes a two-way street of insights, where the feedback they receive is as valuable as the expertise they share.That is the currency of influence on LinkedIn, and many boutique consultancy owners are letting it slip through their fingers.They bypass LinkedIn and bypass deep client understanding.I use this platform to share my knowledge in short form so that my target audience can consume it on the go. Content on my website may gather digital dust and remain unchallenged, whereas LinkedIn breathes split-second life into my words, thinking, and expertise.The result? In the past few years, I’ve written a treasure trove of >500 pages of firsthand knowledge, and I have a backlog of insights to last me (and my readers!) for at least the next two years.To keep myself organized, I have a schedule of the type of content I post throughout the week.

• Monday: I sharea small piece of advicebased on my observations in work with consultancies.

• Tuesday and Wednesday: I share case-based experiences and my advice on how to deal with them. My goal with the LinkedIn posts these days is to challenge typical – yet outdated – thinking in consulting. These posts tend to garner much attention regarding comments, reactions, and impressions.

• Thursday: I share my newsletter

• Friday: I offer my network advice in the form of acarousel post– a format that allows me to provide a fair amount of information in a very user-friendly, reading-on-the-go way. I address oneproblemwithin a post, often using bullet points and list formats to help my network get an “executive summary.”

• Saturday: I reshare my most recent articles with my point of view added to it

• Sunday: cycling day! :-)

LinkedIn has proven to be an effective audience engagement channel for me. I make sure to read all responses, reply to comments as much as possible, thank my followers for new perspectives, and use them as a source of inspiration for the longer pieces I put on the blog. I treat each comment, each share, and each piece of feedback as a free lesson in market demands, client pain points, and industry understanding.Now, here's ‘the shocker’: I never do outreach. I don’t send connection requests on LinkedIn. And I haven't spent a minute on direct sales.And yet, I doubled my followers from 5k to nearly 10k in 2 years. I am fully booked—100% inbound.So, to every consultancy owner or leader, don't you dare tell me you don't have time to share your experiences. And don’t tell me LinkedIn doesn’t work. It does. Every consultancy can do it.

Here’s some data to back it up – curated byMandy McEwan.

• 98% of B2B enterprises see value in social selling, but only 49% have developed social selling programs. (Anthony Barnum)

• Social sellers have a larger volume of new customers(65% vs 47%) and better customer conversion (46% vs 31%) than those not using social media for sales. (Hubspot)

• 96% of business professionals would be more inclined to buy productsor services from businesses whose sales professionals understand the needs of their business. (LinkedIn)

• 75% of B2B buyers and84% of C-level executives are influenced by social mediawhen making purchasing decisions. (IDC)

Creating value by sharing your experiences and transforming your consultancy into a hub of education isn't just a task…

While I make sure to post every day consistently, it barely takes any time. I often use my blog pieces to filter out a single idea and break it down in my LinkedIn post.It works the other way around, too. I frequently make posts inspired by conversations I have with prospects or as a result of comments from followers.Summarizing my advice in a short form, I then use the idea to create a more in-depth piece for The Visible Authority blog.It’s all interconnected.

Consultancy owners and partners saying they don't have time for LinkedIn is like them saying they don't have time to understand the market.

### The Authority newsletter

Last but certainly not least is my newsletter –The Authority– which I send out every other week.I use my newsletter to provide my highly treasured list of subscribers with a catalogue of all the educational pieces I’ve created in the previous two weeks.I make sure to include my blog pieces, LinkedIn posts, shout-outs to community members and those who inspire me, etc. This allows my subscribers to browse my latest content and read posts addressing their most pressing problems.I am very meticulous about nurturing my subscriber list. Growing the list at a certain speed is not my priority. I only care about reaching the right audience – my target audience. I’d rather have 1,500 highly relevant subscribers than 100,000 subscribers from a wider audience.As a result, my open rates are far above any industry average, and my subscribers regularly engage with the newsletter in the form of clicks, responses, comments, etc.I see my newsletter as a dialogue opportunity. It's not just random self-promotional stuff I throw at my database of people.

## How my education-driven strategy fuels my business growth

My education-driven content creation IS my business development strategy.As I, hopefully, made abundantly clear by now in this post, I create content to help my prospects shift their thinking by sharing best practices, providing in-depth advice, and introducing business strategies that high-performing consultancies utilize.When prospects reach out to me, they have little doubt about my expertise. My educational posts have convinced them that I have the required knowledge to help them.I don’t negotiate on pricing. I don’t have endless back-and-forths. In my conversations, I’m incredibly forthcoming about exactly what I do, for who I work, and how I do it.Because of the depth of my expertise, I can deliver transformational outcomes. As a result, 99% of my new leads are ICP-fit: owners or partners of boutique consultancies with approximately 25-150 employees and/or >2M to 25M revenue.My blog articles, newsletter, and daily LinkedIn posts provide most of my prospect qualifications.By the time prospects reach out, they’ve already read at least three pieces of my content during a period of 4-6 months (self-reported attribution).They have browsed through my website multiple times. They already know that they fit in my target audience (because I publicly communicate my ideal client profile all the time), so they know I can assist them.Of course, there are nuances to any education-driven content strategy. For example,in one of my posts, I explain in detail how different types of content can prompt specific actions from the target audience.Similarly, it’s best to figure out what time of day/week your audience is most engaged and try to post accordingly.However, the foundational elements are really not complicated. Ultimately, it boils down to consistent, high-quality content and advice.Recommended reading:Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting Business

## In conclusion

My education-driven content strategy for reaching consultancy owners and leaders is a testament to the power of narrowly-focused expertise sharing.I can constantly grow my reputational footprint as a subject matter expert by consistently providing valuable insights and in-depth advice through various content formats.The expertise, authenticity, and relevance of my content fuel my business growth.I strongly encourage boutique consultancy owners in a hamster wheel of chasing prospects and stressing out about endless follow-ups to change their approach.There is a better way to go about it – it’s better for reclaiming these consultancy owners’ time, for their prospects, and for the business as a whole.Instead of talking to their audience, it’s time to listen to their pain points, struggles, challenges, and business needs and create high-value content that addresses them.

# The 4 I’s of Service Design for Boutique Consultancies

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 24 October 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-4-is-of-service-design-for-boutique-consultancies

---

It amazes me how many boutique consultancies overlook the importance of proper service design. They put together a list of services they offer, determine the fees and a general approach to working with clients within these service offerings, and call it a day.But service design is so much more. It incorporates resource planning, marketing and client recruitment strategies, service offering implementation, client retention strategies, and more. How a consultancy maps out various interactions with prospects and clients and the methodologies it establishes can make or break a consulting business.In this post, I will discuss an approach to service design that I have witnessed repeatedly delivering solid results.

## The building blocks of service design: The 4 I’s

The approach I’m outlining today is a 4-step process that boutique consultancies can use to successfully recruit new clients and maintain long-term relationships with clients and, therefore,  a more secure recurring revenue.Based on this approach, consultancy leaders and their marketing teams can plan business development campaigns, nurture leads, and continuously provide value to clients.The 4 I's of consultancy service design:

• Interest-building

• Initial engagement

• Implementation

• Indefinite retention

Ooh...and if you have multiple services, you can do two things:

• create the 4 I's approach for your most crucial flagship service

• create the 4 I's approach for every service of the consultancy (my favourite, but much work BUT also a motivation to keep the number of services as lean as possible)

I’ll explain each step in more detail.

### Tier 1: Interest–building (self-assessment)

Goal: Inspire prospects to shift their thinking and build trust.

I recommend that consultancies think of a free, low-entry service/tool they can offer their prospects as the first tier in their consultancy service design.A self-assessment service is an excellent example of that. A consultancy can design an online questions-based assessment tool that will serve as a way for prospects to better categorize their pain points, uncover potential roadblocks and mechanisms, and benchmark against other companies of similar size in the industry.The self-assessment tool and the results it presents to prospects facilitate a shift in their thinking: “Am I really so far behind competitors on Process XYZ?”, “I didn’t realize this pain point is an operational challenge that can be permanently eliminated”, “Do I really want to wait till Problem X has such an exponentially large negative impact on Departments 1, 2, and 3?”A free service like this should be enhanced by a library of educational content produced by the consultancy – blog articles, bite-sized advice on LinkedIn, podcast episodes, a newsletter, or a mix of these. This is how the consultancy builds trust with the audience whose interest in a particular area has successfully peaked.A low-entry free offering like a self-assessment tool should be designed to be 100% systematized – it’s something the consultancy puts a lot of thought and effort into setting up and then lets it run.Marketing teams then think of ways to maximize the visibility of the offering (e.g., inserting a CTA in blog articles, promoting a dedicated landing page through social media channels, etc.).

### Tier 2: Initial engagement (discovery service)

The next tier in the service design is a paid, upfront discovery service.An upfront discovery process in consulting is a systematized method of gathering pertinent information on the client’s pressing business problem and analyzing gaps and roadblocks to develop an improvement roadmap that will guide the client to achieve the desired business outcomes.I’ve seen consultancy firms offering this service for free too often. They spend hours and dedicate various resources to diagnosing the state of their prospect. They create custom proposals based on the outcomes of the discovery. Then, way too often, one of two things happens:

• These consultancies engage in endless follow-ups, trying to close this prospect for a paid service.

• After spending valuable resources to conduct the free discovery, it turns out it’s either not the correct type of client, or the consultancies still have no definitive idea of whether the client is the right fit.

Tiers 1 and 2 help consultancies avoid the qualification trap. They enable a boutique consultancy to disqualify the prospect early in case of a non-fit.I strongly encourage boutique consultancies to never start a critical client engagement without a paid, upfront discovery step.This step is an opportunity for consultancies to get a solid understanding of what the implementation will entail and set clear expectations for the client. For clients, it’s also an opportunity to engage consultancies in a low-stake manner – gauge their expertise before committing further financial resources.The end product is an improvement roadmap that outlines the symptoms of the problem, the problem itself, and the implementation process of a solution to the problem.Everybody wins – the consultancy and its clients – when a discovery service is the first paid step in the engagement.Recommended reading:Every Consulting Firm Needs a Discovery ServiceI urge consultancies to standardize (the process, the methodology, the data gathering, etc.) and productize (from a marketing point of view) this tier of service offering.There should be a systemic approach to the discovery service: how long it takes, what it entails, what resources get allocated, how the improvement roadmap is created and shared with the client, etc. The consultancy should know precisely what it takes to conduct the discovery and price it as a package accordingly.

### Tier 3: Implementation

The discovery service is a fantastic way to set up both the consultancy and the client for success in the implementation stage. It enables consultancies to determine the scope of the implementation project and to set proper expectations with the client.The 3rd service tier is the implementation based on the improvement roadmap produced in the 2nd discovery tier.Once again, I strongly recommend that consultancies standardize this service tier as much as possible. Yes, each implementation project should be tailored to the context of each client. However, the methodology should have very little to no variation.Recommended reading:Why A Boutique Consultancy Should Productize Its ExpertiseThis is the service tier where the consultancy delivers on all its promises and expectations set in the discovery stage. The transformational effect of this service tier should be substantial. The consultancy should be able to eliminate the pain point with laser-like precision, executing every step of the improvement roadmap within the targeted timelines utilizing resources that are perfectly trained and experienced to deliver successfully.Implementation should be surgically precise, based on deep expertise, and offer massive value to the client.

### Tier 4: Indefinite retention

Upon completing the implementation of the 3rd tier of the services, consultancies can transition their clients into a long-term type of partnership. The goal is to design a service that continuously adds value to the client.Here, the services themselves depend on the expertise and core competencies of the consultancy. These are just a few examples:

• Continuous monitoring of the client’s processes and a monthly/quarterly report with recommendations

• Health checks

• Training the broader organization of the client to improve adoption

• Mentoring the CEO/CxOs of the company, thus providing the client with peace of mind

• Tech updates/upgrades consulting

• Subscription-based access to benchmarking and other proprietary datasets

Vertical service integration is another way to retain clients past the original implementation service tier.Vertical service integration in consulting refers to the strategic expansion of services within a specific domain of expertise. It's about progressively deepening the consultancy's service offering, providing a spectrum of solutions ranging from broad strategic advice to highly specialized, granular interventions.This approach cultivates richer expertise, enables a more comprehensive service to clients, and fosters a deeper understanding of the patterns, intricacies and nuances within a particular field.Recommended reading:Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies

## Ensuring a balance between client acquisition and retention using the 4 I’s service design framework

I am a big proponent of consultancies striving to derive 70% of their revenue from existing clients through long-term collaboration and 30% through new client acquisition.

As I explain in mydedicated article on this topic, 70/30 is the split that firms should aspire to and that high-performance consultancies come close to. Most consultancies do not achieve and maintain such a ratio.Why is 70/30 between farming and hunting the optimal ratio? Because it puts revenue stability first while leaving a significant portion for growth and expertise development. In my experience working with consultancy firms, this ratio allows firms to grow sustainably.When the bulk of the revenue comes from long-term client engagements, consultancy owners and leaders can project and manage the pipeline of work with a high degree of precision. They can forecast revenue, efficiently plan out and allocate resources, and have enough financial stability to work on the consultancy instead of working in the day-to-day execution of projects.

*Recommended reading:How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting GrowthThe 4 I’s framework I propose facilitates precisely that – creating a 70/30 balance between client retention and client acquisition.*

• Tier 1– Interest-building – provides a mechanism for consistently generating interest in the consultancy’s services and acquiring new clients.

• Tiers 2 and 3– Initial engagement (discovery) and Implementation – allow the consultancy to establish strong relationships with the client by expertly delivering a service.

• Tier 4– Indefinite retention – enables consultancies to set up recurring revenue channels by maintaining long-term client relationships.

Based on this 4-tier service design strategy, consultancies can set up processes, resources, and marketing campaigns. Over time, they can collect data on how well these systems work and optimize them for maximum efficiency and ROI.

## In conclusion

The 4 I's of service design for boutique consultancies offer a framework that boutique consultancy owners and leaders can use to set up their services in a way that enables long-term success.Considering we live in an era of hiring challenges, growing a consulting business by increasing the number of services and consultants is not a sustainable strategy.The four-tiered approach, fromInterest-buildingtoIndefinite retention, provides a structured path for consultancies. It encourages consultancies to provide initial value through free or low-entry services, followed by a paid discovery service that sets clear expectations, defines the scope of intervention and strengthens trust in the expertise.

TheImplementationphase allows consultancies to deliver on their promises with precision, while theIndefiniteretentionphase offers opportunities for ongoing value delivery and continuous collaboration.This framework supports client acquisition and provides consultancy owners with peace of mind in the form of recurring revenue, ultimately leading to a more stable and prosperous consultancy.

# (Case Study) Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 28 September 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/any-consultancy-can-replicate-the-secret-of-this-highly-profitable-consulting-firm

---

Most of the time, consulting leaders reach out to me because their firms are experiencing problems: their business growth has stalled, or they keep having to offer discounts to win projects, or they find themselves going through tedious client recruitment processes.

However, I also spend much time talking to firms that do not need my help. They are hugely successful – they have high profits, their consultants are known as trusted experts, they have low consultant turnover, etc.

I love listening to the stories that leaders in these consulting firms share. It’s an opportunity for me to continuously study and benchmark their financial performance.

In this article, I’d like to share a story of a mid-size consulting firm I got in touch with not too long ago. Let’s call itConsultancy X.

This firm’s annual revenue per full-time employee is 2-3X the market average. They constantly turn away requests from prospects because they do not fit their narrowly defined area of expertise. In fact, there is a waitlist for Consultancy X’s services. It sounds like a dream, right? Well, suffice it to say that they do not need my help.

The reason I’m sharing their story? Because 'the secret' to their success is not some superhuman abilities or an immense amount of luck. It’s a straightforward strategy that any consulting firm can adopt and adapt to its context.

## Consultancy X at a glance

Let me share a few details about this particular consulting firm:

• Context: It’s a highly specialized tech consultancy of around 40 consultants.

• Annual revenue: €15 million.

• Blended day rate: 2-3X market average compared to similar consultancies in this field in this market.

• Annual revenue per FTE(consultants): approx. €400k – the owner explained to me that’s 2-3X the market average.

• Gross margin(=project margin): >60%. Apparently way above their industry average of approx. 20-30%.

• Marketing and business development expenses: close to zero (apart from the content development, see next point)! They get invited almost all the time.

• Thought leadership development: one person, two days per week + 10% of the owner's time (sharing his leading thoughts).

It’s a truly inspiring case! By any standard, this is a high-performance consultancy.

Their project pricing and margins are insane, their employees do not feel pressured to win new business no matter what it takes, and their consultants are widely respected for their deep expertise.

## The foundation of the high-performing Consultancy X

This consultancy achieves such spectacular results because at its foundation is strong positioning that determines all their actions: whom they work with, what projects they take on, how they hire, how they market – everything!

Here are the foundational elements that Consultancy X is doing right (and that other consultancies can replicate).

• They have anarrow focus. Always. They are never tempted to add another service to their list of offerings to win more clients. They deepen their knowledge instead of expanding it into fields outside their narrow focus.

• They have alaser-sharp definition of the target audience and expertise domain. They do not take on implementation work that would require consultants to engage in endless back-and-forths with lower-level team members. Their leading consultants spend 90% of their time working with C-level and higher-level executives. There are no delays “for getting approval from senior management”, there are decisive implementation strategies, most of their projects start from a standardised technology model, and there are no delays in payments.

• Theirdeep expertise is in high demand. Because they were able to carve out a niche and position themselves as the ultimate experts in their narrow field, their services are expensive and hard to get. They always say yes to projects within their narrowly defined domain. Their deep expertise allows them to deliver impressive results for their clients, so prospects come knocking on their door, hoping to achieve similar results with the help of Consultancy X.

> “Give people an abundance of confidence in your expertise by creating an abundance of value and share it again and again”. (Seth Godin)

• They never compete on price.Of course not. They are twice as expensive as other firms in the field. No discounts. No exceptions.

• The firm is extremely well managed. Because the positioning is clear and embedded in the company’s culture, consultants do not need to be micromanaged. Processes are efficient. Audience-education-based marketing works like a well-oiled machine. High profitability is the norm.

• The Prospect qualification process is disciplined. Does an incoming request fit Parameters 1, 2, and 3? No? Then that’s a no-go. Nobody in the firm has a problem saying no to low-value distractions or bad-fit projects. I was amazed at how stark the comparison was in how the leadership talked about their prospect qualification process vis-a-vis many other consultancies I speak to. No hesitation, no FOMO, just a simple “If they don’t fit these parameters, we don’t work with them.”

> “The more irrelevant you become to non-ideal prospects by turning your positioning away from them, the more relevant you become to your chosen target clients”. (David C. Baker)

• Non-linear growth:Through meticulous productization and standardisation of processes, there’s no direct relationship between revenue growth and headcount increase. Most consulting firms’ revenue is constricted to linear growth because the only way to increase revenue is to increase headcount. This is why so many consultancies struggle to grow, especially with the current labour market challenges.

• They are outcome-driven. Because they work in a narrowly defined field and refuse to take on projects outside of their area of expertise, they benefit from the power of repetition. They can predict the outcomes of their work with a high level of precision. When a consultancy says, “We can deliver a 30-40% increase in X and a 20-30% decrease in costs for Y,” and then actually do it, clients are stunned. The client testimonials are amazing. Past clients know exactly how to describe the value of the consultancy to their network.

• They are very visible in the market. I mentioned earlier that this consultancy consistently dedicates time to sharing its thought leadership. Combined with their outcomes-driven case studies and super specific testimonials from past clients who rave about the consultancy’s abilities, this firm achieved top-of-mind market recognition for its deep expertise.

• They do not have recruitment problems. Because of their market reputation and lucrative remuneration packages, they are profoundly attractive to specialists. Consultancy X has no problems attracting the best candidates. Because of their work-from-anywhere approach, they are not bound by their immediate geography and can recruit top talent from anywhere in the region.

• The consultancy’s leader sets the example. The owner of the consultancy practices what he preaches. As a leading thinker, he prioritizes the education of the target audience. He starts his day with a 30-minute reflection, writing, and sharing inspirational insights.

> “Our 60% gross margin target isn’t that difficult to achieve, after all. As long as we keep our narrow focus, repeating similar projects with similar type clients, reducing the variability in process and outcomes, we can remain extremely efficient. (The owner of Consultancy X)

The owner of consultancy X receives acquisition requests from big consultancy firms at least once per month. Based on everything I’ve shared in this article about their positioning and results, I suppose that shouldn’t come as a surprise.

*Recommended reading:[Case Study] Why Offering Too Many Services Destroyed This Boutique Consultancy*

## Why can Consultancy X achieve this and so many others struggle?

I know that Consultancy X sounds too good to be true. But that’s because I shared this firm’s journey's results and their laser-sharp positioning – high profits, stable existing clients, a steady flow of new clients (no outreach at all), low team turnover, etc.

Getting there requires courage and much determination. Only some have the guts to do that.They put all their eggs in one basketand stayed true to that vision despite others warning them of the risks, despite the temptation to get distracted by quick wins, and despite taking time to build up the visibility they currently enjoy. They clearly defined and stayed true to their positioning.

This consultancy was able to grow – both in terms of its size and its profits – because the owner had the unwavering belief in what I call ‘the glorious loop to heaven’:

• A narrow focus is their path to the repetition of similar projects.

• Repetition of similar projects is the path to deeper expertise (and more project efficiency and little variability in outcomes).

• More profound expertise is the path to irresistible value for the client.

• Irresistible value is the path to premium pricing.

• Premium pricing is the path to sustainable profit.

• Sustainable profit builds the self-confidence to protect the narrow focus and the funding for continuous investment in developing leading thoughts.

> It takes focus, specialization, and authority to stand out in an crowded, highly competitive consulting market with risk-avoiding, impatient buyers who can find anything in seconds. I keep telling my clients: your (focused) competitor is only one click away.

## P&L statements reveal the ultimate truth of consultancies’ positioning

It’s possible to ‘blindly read’ a consultancy P&L in the context of positioning, narrow focus, specialization, and value delivery. I’ve done it many times.

Without knowing anything about the consultancy,margins of the well-positioned, narrowly focused, and deeply specialized consulting firm are (with very few exceptions) substantially higher than consultancies trying to be everything to everyone.

The latter consultancies believe that opening their arms wide to everyone can get more business. Unfortunately, consultancies cannot be successful by targeting multiple expertise domains, keeping the options open to protect short-term revenue!

Because of immense competition, there’s too much saturation and too many competitors doing the same thing. It’s a losing battle in profit levels because these ‘jack-of-all-trades’ consultancies are playing in the low-level rate game, beaten up by procurement.

In my experience,if a consultancy hasn’t achieved an irresistible go-to expert positioning in its market, the overall project margins are between ⅓ or even ½ lower than the expert firm high in demand.

AsFlorian M. Heinrichs, Founder and CEO of 'Client Friendly', points out in thecomments sectionof my LinkedIn post on this subject, the benchmark gross margins for the industry are currently at around 54% based onCSIMarket data– “a number far, far above what "not-so-in-demand" consultancies can reach”.

That’s because of high-in-demand consultancies:

• Charge 2 to 3 times more (they add a lot of premium value);

• Achieve revenue per project substantially higher compared to similar consultancies in similar projects for similar clients;

• Earn revenue per FTE of 2 or 3x compared to market averages;

• Obtain higher than average project margins (>60) because of premium pricing in combination with extreme efficiency because of repetition of similar projects for similar types of clients);

That’s easy to ‘discover’ in a P&L.

## In conclusion: short-term pains for long-term gains

Profit is the ‘side-effect’ of this high-performance consultancy’s rock-solid positioning. They stay in their lane. Always.

Sure, it’s easy now when clients are knocking on their doors with all sorts of questions. But starting out it meant passing on lucrative projects to stay on course. And that’s why many consultancies choose not to go this route. And that’s why they don’t win big. They just stay afloat.

It’s time for boutique consultancies to face up to the harsh reality. Firms cannot be everything to everyone and hope to be successful.

Trying to target multiple expertise domains (or audiences or industries) will only lead boutique consultancies down a path of mediocrity and considerable profit erosion.

# Mapping the Journey: The Consultancy Specificity Quadrant

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 26 September 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-consultancy-specificity-quadrant

---

Within the first two minutes of talking to an owner of a boutique consultancy new client, I ask a simple question: “What does your consultancy do?”At this point, it comes as no surprise that owners of high-performing consultancies almost always succeed in giving me a 30-second answer that covers precisely what problem they are solving for which type of clients, how they do it, and what typical outcomes they can achieve.Why? Because a high level of specificity and intentionality is at the foundation of their success and is displayed in the external messaging of these consulting firms. These consultancies are obsessed with specificity and are highly protective of it.When I say “specificity”, I refer to two dimensions:

• specificity in the types of problems a consultancy solves with its services

• specificity in the kind of audience they cater to.

This is what I’ll be discussing in this article – how achieving relevance and deep expertise in a very specific field for a highly targeted audience can supercharge the growth and profitability of a boutique consultancy.

## Shifting Gears: The Consultancy Specificity Quadrant

The success of a boutique consultancy hinges on its ability to define its area of expertise and target audience clearly and narrowly.To help visualise it, I’ve created the consultancy specificity quadrant.

I argue that boutique consultancies must strive to be in theExpert Epicenterquadrant to improve success.What do I mean by “success”? In my view, a boutique consultancy is considered successful when:

• It posts high project margins, north of 40% (or even better: >50%)

• It can forecast its revenue and project pipeline with high precision

• It has significantly lower costs than the average consultancy due to its commitment to optimising & standardising processes and methodologies.

• Owners and leaders of the consultancy can focus on running and developing the business instead of working in the service delivery trenches.

• Consultants work at a steady schedule – there are rarely periods of overstretching or underutilising them.

• It grows organically with prospects knocking on the door as opposed to having to chase leads and by developing the majority of the revenue from existing clients (70% is my sweet spot)

### The Quadrants Explained

Before I explain why and how boutique consultancies should move from theGeneralist Gridto theExpert Epicenter, I’ll clarify what each quadrant means.

TheGeneralist Grid(Q1): This quadrant represents consultancies that offer a broad range of solutions to a wide audience. These consultancies are jack-of-all-trades, offering services in various areas to clients from different sectors.TheSpecialist Spectrum(Q2): Consultancies in this quadrant offer specialised solutions to a broad audience. They have developed expertise in a particular area, but their services apply to various industries/types of clients.TheNiche Navigator(Q3): This quadrant represents consultancies offering a broad range of solutions to a specific audience.TheExpert Epicenter(Q4): This is the quadrant of consultancies that offer specialised solutions to a specific audience. They have developed deep expertise in a particular area and cater to the unique needs of a specific sector or audience.Standing out from the crowd requires a different approach in a world inundated with consultancies claiming they can do almost everything for everybody.That’s where theExpert Epicenterquadrant comes in. It elevates boutique consultancies from obscurity to indispensability.This quadrant is not just a tool to assess a consultancy; it's a challenge. It is a challenge to be specific, to be targeted, and to be an expert.It's a call to move from the crowded ocean of the ‘we-can-do-it-all-consultancy’ to the small pond of targeted specialisation.

*Recommended reading:Why High-Performance Consultancies Are Obsessed with Specificity*

## The journey to the Expert Epicenter quadrant

How long does the journey from Q1 (TheGeneralist Grid) to Q4 (The Expert Epicenter) take? In my experience working with small and medium-sized consultancies, it takes around 2-3 years of committed, targeted consulting work.I will explain why it takes this long (although, in my opinion, 2-3 years to turn a business around entirely is not long at all) by going through the steps that a consultancy must take throughout the journey.

### Developing laser-sharp positioning

First things first – a generalist boutique consultancy needs to determine the direction of specialisation: who the target client will be, what pain points the consultancy will address for this client, and how it will resolve this pain point.The following two research steps are a must at this stage:

• Researching the market: This means deep-diving into the state of the selected industry/sub-sector, the most significant opportunities and challenges in the space, tech and systems utilised across companies, why dominant players can secure their position and more.

• Researching the clients: It is imperative to have an exceptional understanding of the prospective clients. What is their job within organisations? How do their decisions impact the rest of the business? What are their pain points and goals? How do these pain points fit in the larger context of their business? Consultancies need to learn all of this and more about their future target audience.

With these insights, the consultancy should determine its place with powerful, crystal-clear positioning.

### Developing the service concept

Once the positioning has been developed, it’s time to zoom in on the service offering.Here, the consultancy needs to complete the following steps:

• Developing the offering: This involves analysing past projects, conducting in-depth interviews with past clients, identifying patterns in the type of pain points clients in various industries struggle with, ranking these pain points from most pressing/high-impact to not sufficiently important, etc.

• Validating the offering: Not all service offering concepts pan out. That’s why conducting a market-product fit analysis is crucial before fully committing. The consultancy needs to take its offering idea and validate it first.

### Crystalising and streamlining the service concept

Now that the consultancy has a solid idea of what type of pain point it wants to resolve for which clients, it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty of service design. This includes:

• Ensuring repeatability of the service: The consultancy must design a service in a way that requires little to no customisation. It can be replicated and delivered consistently across different clients and scenarios. Repetition in work is the only way to consistently grow the depth of expertise, lower costs by optimising processes, deliver guaranteed results for clients, and identify patterns to increase the value of work further.

• Securing metrics, data, and benchmarks: How will the consultancy measure the impact of its work? How will it measure the effectiveness of the service to both explain the transformational impact of its work to prospects and continuously improve the offering? Furthermore, the consultancy needs to create a system for aggregating this data over time. This will allow it to develop proprietary datasets and establish benchmarks. There is tremendous value in creating exclusive, proprietary data sets – they help consultancies strengthen their credibility and encourage clients to check out their expertise. If meticulously aggregated and maintained, this data can evolve into a unique proprietary asset or intellectual property, increasing the firm's monetary value and enabling it to charge premium fees.

• Developing a stable process and methodology: The consultancy undergoing the journey to the fourth quadrant must have a solid service delivery process. From what tools and expertise will be required to complete projects to what onboarding of clients will look like to the average length of engagement and the milestones to reach for each client – there are dozens of small and large elements that must be accounted for and planned for.

• Making the solution scalable: It is essential that the service offering designed by the consultancy can be scaled up or down without compromising on the quality of outcomes. This will add agility to the firm and, at the same time, predictability in terms of revenue, pipeline forecasting and management, and resource allocation.

### Making internal preparations

Once the new service offering is designed, validated, and streamlined, it’s time to prepare the team and the necessary resources. This involves:

• Training the team and documenting the process for new hires: Every team member – from consultants to marketers and support/admin staff – needs to undergo thorough training on the new service, the methodology, the newly defined positioning, and the strategic vision of why and how the business is experiencing this transformation. Furthermore, the training process must be diligently documented to optimise the onboarding process of new hires in the future.

• Creating a system to document learnings: This step is essential for internal learnings/improvements and target audience education. There is a wealth of knowledge and experience gained from past successes, failures, and struggles that can be used to educate clients and team members. The consultancy must set up a system to capture and share these learnings regularly.

• Setting up a tech stack: Here, I’m referring to the technological tools the consultancy will utilise internally to deliver work to its clients and the technologies it will integrate into its tech stacks.

### Making external preparations

Depending on the service, the consultancy may need to incorporate external or industry-mandated requirements. For example:

• Obtaining certification: If there are market expectations or a requirement for possessing certain certification to offer this type of service, it’s imperative that the consultancy does so for all its consultants.

• Adhering to compliance requirements: Once again, if the industry/nature of the work performed for the client mandates adherence to specific rules and regulations, the consultancy must acquire a deep understanding of these rules and integrate compliance into its service delivery design.

### Redefining marketing, business development, and sales strategies

Now that the internal and external preparations are done, the consultancy needs to define the strategy and parameters of its client recruitment efforts. Some of the elements the consultancy must consider are:

• Collecting strong client testimonials: Social proof plays a significant role in the ability of a consultancy to attract clients. Just like we, as consumers, read reviews before purchasing a product, senior executives do their homework and read the testimonials from past clients. It is a way to minimise the risk of the purchase. And they are not looking for the general “this consultancy is great” type of testimonials. They want to hear how effectively the consultancy solved specific problems for other clients.

• Committing to audience education: To develop a reputation for deep expertise, the consultancy – and here, I’m talking about consulting leaders and consultants alike – must develop its voice and point of view. Each consultant should strive to become known as a thought leader within their niche. That means continuously creating and sharing content that educates the target audience. This is also how a consultancy builds trust with its prospects and how it gets discovered through online searches.

> "There’s a chasm between an old-school and a new-school mindset. The old-school consultancy refuses to share its expertise. The belief is that clients and competitors will steal their know-how. The new-school consultancy believes in the power of sharing/educating and considers it strategic."

"There’s a chasm between an old-school and a new-school mindset. The old-school consultancy refuses to share its expertise. The belief is that clients and competitors will steal their know-how. The new-school consultancy believes in the power of sharing/educating and considers it strategic."

• Developing and documenting marketing and sales processes: What is the typical journey a prospect goes through before becoming a client? What are the main touchpoints and platforms the marketing team should focus on? What is the strategy for retaining clients? How are marketing efforts measured? There are a ton of questions that must be addressed and documented to optimise the effectiveness of marketing and sales down the line.

*Recommended reading:Why Are Consultancies Appointing New Partners Without a Voice?This list is by no means exhaustive. I can write twice as much on positioning alone. However, I hope I clarified why a boutique consultancy needs 2-3 years to move towards theExpert Epicenterquadrant.*

### The Non-linear Journey to theExpert Epicenter

I’ve learned in the past years that the journey to theExpert Epicenteris far from a straight path. It's a winding journey with twists, turns, advances, and retreats. Most consultancies, starting from the ‘we-can-do-it-all’Generalist Gridof Q1, often find themselves meandering either through theSpecialist Spectrumof Q2 or navigating the intricate paths of theNiche Navigatorin Q3.Each quadrant presents challenges and opportunities, and the progression is rarely linear. There will be moments of validation where the direction feels right, interspersed with instances of failure that necessitate recalibration. It's a dance of moving left and right, up and down, constantly refining and redefining one's focus.

With all its complexities, this journey is a testament to the evolving nature of consultancy, emphasising that success is not just about reaching a destination but also about the insights and growth experienced along the way.

I havewritten 2 case studiesof consultancies that have moved to the Q4 Quadrant in several - sometimes tricky - steps. Recommended reading!

## In conclusion

For boutique consultancies, success is all about 'being specific' about who they help and how they solve this target audience’s problems.TheExpert Epicenterquadrant represents the pinnacle of specificity, where consultancies offer specialised solutions to a specific audience.By focusing on a targeted specialisation, a boutique consultancy can develop deep expertise, tailor its services to the unique needs of its audience, and establish itself as a trusted expert in its field.Therefore, it is highly recommended that boutique consultancies strive to move towards theExpert Epicenterquadrant.This focus will help differentiate the consultancy from competitors and lead to more meaningful and impactful relationships with clients.

# Getting Over 'The Project Wall' To Grow A Consultancy Firm

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 18 September 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/getting-over-the-project-wall-to-grow-a-consultancy-firm

---

This article was last updated on 18 September 2023

I often conduct workshops with mid-sized consulting firms as a follow up to a positioning audit I conduct for them. One of the discussions that comes up during such workshops rather frequently is how boutique consultancies and mid-sized firms can move away from project-level work to C-level involvement with their clients. In this post, I summarize the main points of such discussions and the strategies I've shared with consultancies over the years.

But first, I'll provide a quick review of the altitude of involvement concepts in consulting business models.

## Project- vs C-level work in consulting

Project-level work is low-altitude. It centers primarily around day-to-day execution and/or implementation work, which has relatively low impact on the clients' true pains.

C-level work, on the other hand, is high-altitude. It's all about high-level strategic and/or diagnostic advisory. This type of work tends to have a relatively big impact on the clients' true pains. High-performing consultancies tend to fall in the latter category. They position their offering as "transformative", which means the work requires deep expertise and they are able to charge premiums.

Switching to the C-level ‘client transformation’ consulting approach is THE #1 pillar of success in consulting – the type of success where consultancies regain control of their time, when consultancy owners comfortably and organically grow their business and pick which projects their teams work on (and say NO to any project outside of the consultancy's focus zone), and where marketing is inbound.

## Hitting and overcoming the 'Project Wall'

Unfortunately, too many consultancies never get over ‘the project wall’. They wish to become strategic advisors but get stuck in lower-value project work (or even ‘body shopping’).Here is a visual representation of the growth trajectory.

### Typical characteristics of consulting work in front and behind the wall

#### Characteristics of the project work ‘in front of the wall’

• Frantic pace and high unbillable time: Consultancies tend to engage in a never-ending cycle of writing proposals, pitching, and onboarding new clients – all of which leads to significant time that cannot be billed, causing inefficiency and stress.

• Low revenue/FTE: A lack of high-value projects results in diminished revenue generation per employee or a sub-standard ‘cost-to-revenue’ ratio.

• Growth ceiling: These consultancies growth pattern gets stagnant. They are unable to break through to new levels of expansion and success.

• High cost of sales (COS) to acquire new clients: The constant need to win new clients leads to significant sales costs, draining resources that could be allocated elsewhere.

• Capacity issues: Over-extension causes internal capacity challenges, disrupting workflow and potentially affecting the quality of deliverables.

• Financial instability and uncertainty: Fluctuating revenue streams and the ever-present need to secure new projects create an environment of uncertainty and stress in consultancies in front of the wall.

• Employee burnout risk: The relentless pace often leads to employee fatigue and burnout, affecting performance and retention.

• Lack of long-term client relationships: Since such consulting firms tend to focus on one-off projects, they miss opportunities for deeper client engagement and recurring revenue.

• Reactive instead of proactive approach: The continuous scramble for new projects promotes a reactive culture, missing the opportunity to position a consultancy for future success strategically.

Did I paint a vivid picture of 'hitting the project wall' in consulting? Understanding these signs is crucial for transforming towards a more strategic, stable, and growth-oriented consulting approach.Relying on one-time projects is like running a race with ever-changing finish lines. Each completed project leads to another wall, another beginning, with no momentum or cumulative growth.My friendSimon Collardwould say: in a state of ‘existential fragility’.

*Recommended reading:The Negative Impact of Obsessive Revenue Focus in Consulting*

#### Characteristics of consulting work ‘behind the wall’

• Minimal unbillable time: The proposals process tends to be highly standardized and optimized due to the very narrow range of services offered. In fact, almost every process and system in such high-performing consultancies behind the wall is optimized for maximum efficiency. They are able to do that due to repetition in types of projects they deliver and continuous commitment to deepen the expertise.

• High revenue/FTE due to value-based premium pricing: These consultancies do not sell availability. They sell the transformational value they deliver to clients. As a result, their profit margins are high and their revenue growth is not directly tied to headcount growth.

• Low cost of sales (COS) to acquire new clients: Because of the strong positioning of such consultancies as exceptional experts in a narrow field and their reputational footprint backed by social proof, such firms spend very little – if anything – on marketing and business development.

• Strong capacity planning: Resources and team members can be allocated to projects with high accuracy. With forecast planning usually quite meticulous and precise in such firms, overstretching or underutilizing staff and resources is an exception rather than the rule.

• Financial stability: High-performing consultancies behind the wall secure financial stability through recurring revenue sources – be it monthly retainers, subscription-based models, or long-term client projects. New business is used for business growth, to diminish the risk of financial dependency on a few big clients, and to keep the pricing at healthy levels.

• Solid employee retention rates: These consulting firms rarely face high employee turnover problems. Revenue is predictable. There is no pressure on individual consultants to sell. Consulting leaders at such firms tend to place a lot of value into continuous learning, enabling consultants to deepen their expertise. There is prestige associated with working at such high-performing consultancies due to their strong reputational footprint.

• Proactive and strategic approach to consultancy management: Financial stability and the ability to say no to incoming requests gives consulting leaders the time and space to think of business growth and management strategically instead of making reactive decisions. They have the luxury to set the parameters for where they want to see their business in 2/5/10 years and make decisions that can deliver success over the long term as opposed to chasing short-term wins.

*Recommended reading:Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies*

In his book, ‘Crossing The Chasm’, Geoffrey Moore talks about 'the chasm' – a concept similar to what I refer as a 'project wall'. His definition of ‘the chasm’: reaching a plateau and struggling to move to the next level.

When I talk to the consulting firms struggling with ‘the wall’ (or ‘the chasm’), most of them have the ambition to get over the wall but don’t know how to start that journey.

I’ve been there, got the t-shirt.

## How to get over the wall

Every boutique consultancy hits the project wall on the road to building a more mature firm. I’ve been there myself, and sometimes it was very frustrating.But 'getting over the wall' became my obsession. I planned to become the TRUSTED ADVISOR by doing these 5 things:

• Strategic service offering design: This involves developing a comprehensive service portfolio that goes beyond just completing a project. It's about creating a continuum of services that align with the evolving needs of clients. This approach not only ensures client retention but also opens doors for upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

• Building long-term executive-level relationships: The focus here is on cultivating deep and meaningful relationships with high-level decision-makers. By engaging with executives, consultants can gain insights into the strategic direction of the client's company, enabling them to tailor their services more effectively and become indispensable partners.

• Goal setting assistance for clients: Consultants should actively participate in their clients' goal-setting processes. This isn't just about understanding their short, medium, and long-term objectives but also about aligning your consultancy's offerings with these goals. This alignment ensures that the consultancy is seen as a critical player in achieving these objectives.

• Support in building budgets & teams: Here, the consultancy's role expands into advising on the allocation of resources and the structuring of teams. This advice should be grounded in the consultancy's domain expertise, ensuring that the client is equipped with the right resources and human capital to achieve their goals.

• Advising on data collection for decision support: In today's data-driven world, guiding clients on how to collect and analyze data for insightful decision-making is crucial. This involves not just the technical aspects of data collection but also understanding how to interpret this data to provide strategic insights and support decision-making processes.

My advice pivots around transforming a consultancy from a transactional service provider into a strategic partner. This shift involves deeply integrating the client's business strategy, thoroughly understanding their long-term goals, and providing tailored data-driven advice. By doing so, consultancies can break through the project wall, moving towards a more sustainable and growth-oriented business model.

### A few factors to watch out for

Lack of executive advisory expertise in consulting teamsIn my observations of the consultancy landscape, firms that have primarily focused on short-term projects often find themselves lacking in the skills necessary for high-level executive engagement.It’s a significant challenge to reorient a project-centric team to become adept at executive advising. For leaders of boutique consultancies, the key is not to abandon project work but to enhance your team's capabilities by hiring consultants with 'upstream-savvy' skills.These professionals should excel in understanding and aligning with client executives' strategic goals. Integrating such talent allows your consultancy to maintain its strength in project delivery while simultaneously elevating its role to a strategic partner. This dual approach ensures the continuation of successful project work alongside the development of deeper, more strategic relationships with clients, providing a comprehensive service that addresses both immediate project needs and long-term executive objectives.When I shared my article on LinkedIn, I got a few great comments fromConsulting Professor Joe O’Mahoney.

• Comment 1: In an attempt to ‘jump over the wall’, consultancies should be careful to transform a project offering into a strategic offering. This is (a) too risky and (b) turns their back on 'bread and butter' revenue. They should attempt to do both to leverage strategic relationships to deliver the projects more widely.

• Comment 2: Moving ‘upstream’ as a consultancy is really, really difficult. Prof. O’Mahoney: “I don't think I've met a CEO who hasn't said 'we trying to move our relationships upstream to the CXO suite. Everyone wants to do it but not everyone has the capability, offering, or relationships to make this happen. The C-suite is the most contested area for consultancies”.

## Final advice

Hitting the project wall is not a dead-end.

It’s not easy to move into C-level type of work for consultancies that have been doing project work in an organization for a long time. And going for premium pricing after years of lower-level project pricing could cause a few stupefied client faces.My advice will always be to first test and develop ‘crossing the wall’ activities with new clients.

# How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting Growth

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 11 September 2023

This article was last updated on 11 September 2023

Client retention vs. client acquisition – what is a healthy balance between the two in consulting business?Should they prioritize retaining clients and ensure pipeline predictability and revenue reliability?Or is it better to allocate most of the time to acquiring new clients, expanding the reach, and adding client diversity to daily work?My readers know I am a huge proponent of nurturing and expanding relationships with current and past clients (I discuss it at length in this article).However, it’s not as simple as ‘prioritize client retention at all costs’. There is a lot more depth and nuance to it than that. When approached incorrectly, a consulting growth strategy based almost entirely on client retention can undermine that growth.So in this article, I’d like to discuss the risks and benefits of client retention and acquisition – or farming and hunting in consulting – and how high-performing consultancies maximize the benefits of each while neutralizing the risks.

## Hunting vs. farming in consulting growth

I see client retention as an act of farming. Of course.It’s about ensuring the soil is fertile, planting and nurturing the seeds, and harvesting the crop. Much like farming, client retention is a long-term activity. It’s about commitment and repetition – year after year.Client acquisition, on the other hand, is similar to hunting. It’s unpredictable and consumes a lot of energy. A hunter may strike gold and return with a deer in just a couple of hours or spend days in the woods and have only a couple of pheasants to show for it.Regarding business development and growth in consulting, firms have to devise a balanced hunting-farming strategy that allows them to have a solid foundation of predictable revenue while leaving room for growth and new opportunities.That starts with understanding both the risks and benefits of client acquisition and client retention practices.

### Benefits of farming

The main benefits of farming in consulting are stability and the opportunity to deepen consulting expertise.

• Stability: existing client revenue is critical to the stability of a consultancy (small or big). It gives consulting leaders peace of mind and a cash flow buffer. It allows them to be precise in planning and allocating resources. It protects from excessive revenue volatility.It reduces the amount of resources that must be spent on client acquisition to fill up the pipeline of projects. Pipeline forecasting and management become more accurate and straightforward when retained clients channel a large amount of revenue.

• Expertise depth: working with existing clients over long periods forces consultancies to continuously strive for depth in expertise. The more the firm gets to know its client, the larger the context for the client’s pain points becomes. Now, instead of only looking at the immediate context of a single department, for example, the firm acquires the knowledge of various external factors that can significantly impact the pain points – industry trends, regulatory background, competitors, etc.By working with the same clients over and over again, consultancies have the opportunity to make their offerings increasingly valuable.

• Cross-selling: establishing long-term partnerships with clients means building and growing trust. This, in turn, allows firms to identify cross-selling opportunities – be it the services offered by a different department or consulting leader or offering services to another geographical region.

• Social proof and referrals: existing clients make for excellent case studies and generate referenceable work. Consulting firms can showcase in their social proof the immediate impact of the initial project and the long-term value it can deliver to its prospects.It also makes it easier to acquire new clients through references. Once a client trusts the consultancy and sees the value of working with it, this client is more likely to recommend the consultancy to its network – not to mention the particular, results-driven type of reference that the client is now able to provide.

• Pilots, tests, proof of concepts, validation of new methodologies: trusted, long-term clients are perfectly positioned to test new services, value propositions, and methods. Before rolling out a new service to the market or announcing new positioning, consulting firms must gather feedback. This is best accomplished by having in-depth discussions with the inner circle of clients, who are more likely to listen and engage.

• Standardization of processes and concepts: delivering the same work every month/quarter/year allows firms to develop efficiency gains. Repetition makes it easy to spot inefficiencies, set up processes, optimize tech stacks, create new, more efficient methodologies, forecast precisely how much time is needed for each task and which staff member is best suited to perform it, etc.This type of standardization of processes and concepts is hard to achieve when a consultancy’s time primarily caters to new clients with unique needs and challenges.

• Lifecycle discovery: establishing long-term engagements with clients allows consultancies to discover typical client journeys over a more extended period. It can trace how a solution the firm helped the client transition to is getting adopted across various departments over time. It can be gaining a deeper understanding of how the firm's processes helped the client establish an impact on the rest of the company.

• Better profitability: Developing existing clients boosts profitability. Acquiring new clients is expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, existing clients already trust the consultancy, leading to lower BD costs. In my experience, long-term clients often have larger budgets for projects, and with established processes and knowledge, the consultancy can deliver services more efficiently. This reduces costs and increases margins.

### The dark side of farming

Of course, there are some inherent risks in placing most revenue in the hands of existing clients. Consulting leaders must be acutely aware of these traps and design strategies to avoid them. These traps include:

• Shifting power dynamics: consultancies risk losing power due to revenue dependency on existing clients. Existing clients became too dominant in the relationship with increasing price erosion and scope creep.

• Pleaser syndrome: firms with a large percentage of revenue generated by only a handful of clients also feel pressured to please these clients at all costs or risk losing a big chunk of revenue. It’s not uncommon for existing clients to ask all sorts of small stuff, and the consultancies become order takers instead of trusted advisors (with pricing consequences) to please the client.This also means that consultancies gradually transition into hourly work instead of value-driven project work. Their contribution is now measured by the number of hours they performed instead of the value of the outcomes they deliver. This results in the devaluation of consultancies’ work and income.

• Growth limitations: While growing the amount of revenue a single client delivers over time is possible, relying on farming as a primary source of business growth is unrealistic. Firms must remain proactive in adding new clients to the portfolio – growth will stall without it.

### Benefits of hunting

While client retention creates stability and expertise depth, client acquisition keeps the consultancy sharp and allows it to grow.The main benefits of hunting in consulting are:

• Pipeline growth: regularly infusing the pipeline of projects with new clients protects that pipeline from getting stale. It’s the main engine of growth.

• Reputational growth: high-performance consultancies use their project work to grow their reputational footprint. New clients mean new case studies, new insights into the target market's pain points, new perspectives on upcoming trends, etc. It also means more referral work, word-of-mouth marketing, and industry awareness of the consulting firm's expertise.

• Pricing health: consistently adding new clients allows consultancies to maintain a certain level of pricing and, as a firm's expertise deepens and the resulting value of a consulting offering increases, to increase the pricing level.As mentioned earlier, losing the power to a select few clients risks devaluing a firm's work. Recruiting new clients allows firms to counteract that.

### The dark side of hunting

Hunting in consulting has serious downsides, and consulting owners and partners must be mindful of these disadvantages.

• High(er) cost of acquisition: the rule of sales and marketing has always been that acquiring a new client is exponentially more expensive than retaining an existing one. I’ve noticed that this problem is further aggravated by so many consulting leaders who have no idea what their client acquisition cost is. They fail to measure the resources and hours it takes to acquire a new client and, as a result, fail to make data-driven decisions on tweaking and optimizing the process over time.

• High cost of client onboarding: it is resource-demanding to get the project going with a new client. In the initial stages, it’s all about figuring out how many people to allocate towards a project, spending hours on introductory calls, mapping out the strategy, putting together the correct tech stack, etc.

• Lack of revenue predictability: making accurate revenue projections for firms that generate the most revenue from one-off projects and new clients is nearly impossible. Without such predictability of revenue, it’s much harder to plan out resources, staffing and make growth projections.This, in turn, puts tremendous pressure on consulting owners and practice leaders. They always feel the need to “hustle” to win new business. They either underutilize their employees or overstretch them. They chase new opportunities and say yes to non-ideal clients, constantly stretching out the scope of offered services and driving the pricing down.

• Resource planning difficulties: a natural – and unfortunate – consequence of the lack of revenue predictability is the inability to plan out resource utilization efficiently. Consulting leaders and owners are never sure how many team members will be needed for the next quarter, whether it makes sense to renew contracts with vendors or put them on hold, which marketing collaterals to request, and so on.

• Quality of life erosion: the risks of hunting that I outlined here come at the high cost of diminished quality of life for everyone involved – consultancy owners, senior leaders, team leaders, entry-level consultants, and admin and support staff. The lack of predictability and stability creates a stressful environment all around.There is rarely a happy middle – employees tend to get overworked or underutilized, making them wonder if their employment will be terminated. Consultancy owners always feel the need to be ON – looking for new opportunities, constantly trying to engage the network in search of projects, sending dozens of follow-ups on payment delays, and hundreds of other stress factors.

## Balancing the farming-hunting practices

Client retention and acquisition are two essential practices; no firm can grow organically with only one.So what is that magic ratio that consultancies should strive for? I am a big believer in the 70/30 ratio – 70% of revenue coming from existing clients retained over long periods and 30% from new clients, one-off projects, etc.

### The 70/30 split that consultancies should strive for

I want to preface this part by saying that most consultancies will not achieve the precise 70/30 ratio.Instead, this is the split that firms should aspire to and that high-performance consultancies come close to. It can be 75/25 one year, 60/40 another year, and 80/20 the following year. Such deviations are not a reason for concern.If, on the other hand, these ratios change as 70/30 in Year 1, 80/20 in Year 2, 90/10 in Year 3, or the opposite – 50/50 in Year 1, 40/60 in Year 2, 30/70 in Year 3 – now THAT is a strong indicator that the consulting firm might be in trouble.Why is 70/30 between farming and hunting the optimal ratio? Because it puts revenue stability first while leaving a significant portion for growth and expertise development.In my experience in working with consultancy firms, this ratio allows firms to grow at a sustainable pace.

### Avoiding the dangers of farming and hunting

Earlier in this post, I outlined the benefits and dangers of farming and hunting in consulting.Now, I’d like to discuss how to minimize the dangers of creating business development and scalable business management strategies over time.The most significant disadvantage of client acquisition is the unpredictability it adds to a consultancy’s pipeline.Relying too heavily on new clients to generate revenue puts enormous pressure on consulting owners to constantly recruit new clients – I explained all that earlier.Firms can counteract this risk by expanding the revenue generated by existing clients and reducing the revenue percentage of new clients to 30%.

#### Lowering the cost of client acquisition

I urge firms to examine their current practices closely regarding the high client acquisition cost. How much time does it take, on average, to recruit a new client? What is a marketing funnel typically like? How many people are involved in recent client acquisitions? What is the primary source of new clients?“But Luk, client acquisition in consulting is not a precise science!” I’ve heard some variations of this statement more times than I can count.And you know which firms this statement usually comes from? The ones that rely heavily on networking to recruit new clients. No wonder they do not know how to measure their business development efforts. What are the metrics to use?Recommended reading:Relying On the Network Is A High-Risk Consulting Growth StrategyOn the other hand, high-performance consultancies have dozens of metrics to evaluate their business development efforts.Their client acquisition is made primarily by establishing and growing their reputational footprint, and most of their marketing is done digitally.They measure their readership, audience engagement, open and click-through rates, and other digital metrics. This, in turn, allows them to review the process and optimize it, significantly driving down client acquisition costs.Among the essential KPIs that high-performance consultancies obsessively measure and track are win rates and deal closing times. They want to know precisely how long it takes to bring a new client on board, what the main objections are, how to address them before they even come up, how to decrease the number of back-and-forths required to close a deal, which types of prospects are most likely to convert, etc.

#### Avoiding the trap of client dependency

Regarding farming, consultancies can counteract the risk of client dependency and work devaluation by strategically evaluating long-term work potential and developing value-driven services that remain relevant over a long period.I’ve seen many consultancies develop a dependency on a select few clients. Typically, these clients account for between 40% and 80% of revenue.Because of the revenue importance, these firms feel like they have to cater to every request from these clients – irrespective of how much outside of the scope of the initial service offering it is.I suggest consultancies incorporate a long-term work potential evaluation system into the client onboarding stage.Is there enough scope of work with this new client to aim for a long-term partnership? Can the pain points be resolved in a single project, or do they require continuous maintenance?Firms should not be afraid to let clients go when they see the downward projection in the partnership. They shouldn’t wait till they develop that revenue dependency when it becomes exponentially more challenging.Furthermore, consultancies should re-think their service offering. Instead of trying to diversify their service portfolio horizontally, constantly expanding the scope of their expertise and competing on pricing, they should think of complementary services within the narrow scope of their expertise.Some examples of such services that can be offered over a long period include:

• Audits: Conducting quarterly audits to ensure the client remains on the right path – after all, it’s cheaper for a client to address a problem the moment it occurs than try to fix it down the line when it spreads and multiplies.

• Training: Conducting regular training sessions for the latest hires will bring new employees up to speed on the processes, technologies, and practices of the client that the consultancy helped develop.

• Monitoring: Offering regular monitoring and insights – these can be exclusive reports or sessions that would bring the client up to speed on the trends and patterns the firm has observed over the last 6 months, the previous year, etc. Have competitors introduced new technologies that allowed them to reduce operational costs significantly? Are there regulatory developments brewing that risk negatively impacting the client’s business?

• Guidance: Providing C-level ‘over-the-shoulder’ guidance to give them peace of mind during critical transformations (with a subscription).

There are many other ways to vertically extend the service offering to protect market positioning – I offer various ideasin a separate post on the subject.These service offerings should be designed to provide real value without expanding the scope of expertise – to the contrary, offering the firm an opportunity to deepen its expertise. This is what I witness high-performance consultancies do on repeat.

#### Securing the 70% sweet spot

So where should the journey of getting to the 70% sweet spot commence?

• Key account management:I recommend that consultancies begin by upping their account management game. Consulting leaders/owners and their teams alike should learn best practices for key account management and cross-selling. Key account management is a skill. It involves keeping your finger on the pulse of your clients' needs, priorities, and goals. This requires regular check-ins and continuous engagement via education. This is the only way to discover opportunities for deeper cooperation.

• High altitude of involvement: The most impactful client development and cross-selling happen at the C-level. Consultancies that want to develop long-term engagements with their clients should strive to develop trust and ongoing communication with the C-level. This is an opportunity to understand the biggest pain points of clients' business – what business goals they want to achieve and the macro problems they are facing on a daily basis.

• Multithreading: In order to infuse the relationships with clients with stability, consultancies should strive to connect deeply and broadly within the client organization. Why? Because people change jobs all the time. Establishing relations across an organization and showing the value of the consultancy's work across the board makes the account more stable in the event of a direct contact or champion changing roles or leaving the company altogether.

• Strategic service offering design: To be able to maintain clients past the initially contracted service, consultancies should re-imagine their service offering. As mentioned earlier, it's about designing services that do not push the boundaries of an existing expertise domain but rather deepen the value or provide complimentary benefits for clients within the same domain. The initial client engagement then becomes a trust-building exercise, where the consultancy proves its ability to deliver value and is able to successfully secure a long-term relationship with that client.

## In conclusion

Running a consulting business can be overwhelming. I get that.There is the constant pressure to be on top of things. Economic uncertainty doesn’t help.However, consulting leaders should never let the stress and the pressure of managing and growing a consulting business create chaos in their approach.Metrics, targets, and ratios allow consulting leaders to find their bearings amid uncertainty.They enable consulting owners and partners to be deliberate in their farming and hunting efforts. They force consultancies never to lose sight of long-term goals.

# A Business Development Template Consultancies Can Use to Introduce Their Firms

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

---

This article was last updated on 11 September 2023.When pitching a consulting firm to potential clients, what's the best way to introduce them? Most consulting leaders default to talking about the consultancy’s history or impressive lineup of consultants.

But there's a better way to make an impression - by highlighting the firm's unique achievements in solving problems. In other words, focus on the firm's client-centered outcomes that were achieved in previous projects.

The outside, client-centered view instead of the inside, self-centered view.

In this post, I’d like to share this template and explain why consultancies should aim to always introduce their firms according to it.

And by the way, there’s no difference: solo, small, medium, and big consultancy, everybody can use this introduction template.

## The template for introducing a consultancy with a client-centered, outside view

Readers of this article probably wonder why I am writing about the subject of introducing a consultancy. Well, it’s easy to explain: I hardly ever see attractive introductions.

The 98% I am experiencing on an everyday basis is boring, self-centered, sameness-sick (everybody is saying the same things), and not at all output-driven (achievements with clients) or client-centered.

Those who have made it ‘to the other side’ will always score and will have remarkable pitch results.

Not because of the client-centered introduction (only) but because of their overall habit of putting the client at the center of everything they do.

Let’s get started.

Here’s the template to introduce the consultancy, developed in the spirit of: ‘Client achievements our consultancy is known for’ (instead of saying: “Here’s what we do”).

Here are the 8 components of the client-centered introduction (examples follow below):

• Clients usually call us for help with… (overarching problem statement clients are suffering from)

• They commonly suffer from… (typical pain points detail)

• Typically these clients are… (target client clarification, fast disqualification)

• What they routinely achieve when working with us is… (outcomes, outcomes, outcomes)

• Here’s how it works... (high-level information on how collaboration generally works or starts)

• Trigger point(s) to call us... (identification of common problems the target audience experiences)

• Our entry service... (a service that typically kicks off a collaboration with a client)

• Thought leadership pillar themes... (speaking to the pain points that are typically covered by thought leadership)

That’s it. In under a minute, consultancies can explain to their prospects what problems they tackle, how they do it, and what former clients have achieved – the most important information to make a powerful impression.

I’ll explain all the details below. But first, let’s get rid of the inward way of thinking.

### The outward, client-centered vs. the inward, self-centered presentation of a consultancy

As I already said, in my experience, the majority of consultancies tend to introduce themselves in an inward-looking, self-centered way:

• We are the most experienced in X (how do you know, there are 1,000’s of others doing exactly the same thing, maybe even better)

• We have a combined expertise of 80 years (even brand new expert consultancies - with only 2 years on the meter - can solve complex problems)

• We are client-centered (no, you are not, if you talk about yourself)

• We have a great team and a super culture (everybody says that, clients might like it, but in the end, they don’t really care)

• We are easy to work with (that’s nice, but not relevant to differentiate)

• We are affordable in our pricing (help, you’ve just shot yourself in the foot)

• Blah blah blah (and more self-centered bragging)

These introductions are 100% focused on the consultancy instead of the prospect.

They are boring, they are utterly unpersuasive, and they are totally uninspiring. And they are drowning in the sea of sameness. Everybody says the same BS.

It’s time to stop! Consultancies should take a step back and listen to that introduction from the prospects’ perspective.

• Why should they care?

• What pain points that keep them up at night do they think the consultancy can address?

• Why should they trust this consultancy to help address these pain points?

• How can they start working with a consultancy with minimal risk?

The inside, self-centered positioning tends to get reflected in everything consultancies do:

• how they introduce themselves at pitches or events

• how they talk about their services on their websites

• how they create their “thought leadership” pieces (putting “thought leadership” in quotation marks because these are really self-promotional, low-value pieces, disconnected from the prototypical client challenges)

• how they hire and train new consultants

• how they manage the consultancy

• how they develop and design new services (without proper client validation)

Yes, in everything!

### The client-centered template and its individual parts

To help you understand how it works...here’s how I am doing it.

When I get the question to explain who I am or what I do, I always turn that into a client-centered statement: “Well, clients usually call me because they struggle with the business development in their consultancy”.

Part 1 below is the overarching problem (in my case: challenges with consulting business development).

And I continue explaining what exactly these business development problems are (part 2) and who typically these clients - who call me - are (part 3).

I continue my introduction by briefly explaining what tangible outcomes typically can be achieved (part 4) and how a collaboration usually starts (part 5).

Finally, I give a brief explanation of the trigger points that make prospects reach out to me (part 6), what the first step in our collaboration entails (part 7), and the type of thought leadership content that I produce that the prospect can consult (part 8).

I always strive to do this in 1 minute or less, explaining those 8 client-centered statements. You bet it took a while to get there, and I rehearsed it many times.

So, let’s dive into more detail about the 8 components next.

#### Part 1: The overarching problem statement clients are suffering from

This is where consultancies should give the macro perspective. What is the overarching challenge most of their prospects try to solve?

It could be an inefficient process. It could be the use of legacy technologies that are slowing down their operations. It could be the lack of expertise in identifying the right areas for analytics projects.

Every consultancy should leverage its expertise and past client work to identify the common theme of the problems that their prospects experience.

At first view, this might sound a little abstract. It’ll become more obvious in the examples below.

#### Part 2: Typical pain points

This is where consultancies zoom in on more specific pain points. For example, if we are talking about the prospect’s company using legacy technologies that are slowing down their operations as an overarching problem, the lack of integration experience would be a specific pain point within the overarching problem.

In my experience, most consulting firms only talk broadly about their services without focusing on the specific pain points of their target audience.

However, this approach will likely leave potential clients feeling unconnected and unclear about how a consultancy can help solve their problems.

Consulting firms should instead focus on talking directly about their client's pain points to create an immediate connection with that target audience.

#### Part 3: Target client clarification

This is the perfect opportunity to qualify prospects. Consultancies should be upfront about what types of clients would benefit most from their services.

It could be CHROs in large FMCG companies, or CIOs in the healthcare sector, or CFOs of small- and mid-size companies in the IT sector.

Client disqualification is an important step in protecting the time/efficiency of consultants in the firm and avoiding taking on projects that do not fit into the narrowly defined focus of the consultancy.

> "What consultants need is the confidence that "the void" that is created by saying no, becomes an opportunity to do things that bring them further and closer to what they want to do. And with that comes the confidence that something else will come along, because they're worth it". (David Ducheyne, founder of Otolith Consulting)

"What consultants need is the confidence that "the void" that is created by saying no, becomes an opportunity to do things that bring them further and closer to what they want to do. And with that comes the confidence that something else will come along, because they're worth it". (David Ducheyne, founder of Otolith Consulting)

#### Part 4: Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes

What can the prospects expect to achieve by working with this consultancy? Here, I’m talking about clearly defined, tangible outcomes.

Which processes will improve as a result? By how much will efficiency improve or employee turnover fall?

I urge consultancies to go through their past client work and put together a list of the end result of their work. What’s the “promised land” that they help their clients transition to from their current pain-ridden state?

#### Part 5: High-level information on the process

Without going into details, consultancies should be able to briefly summarize what a collaboration with them entails. Does it start with an audit? Is it a series of design workshops conducted over a 4-month period? Where does the process start? Who’s involved?

This will help prospects understand what they would be committing to by collaborating with a specific consulting company – the types of team members who would need to be involved, how long the collaboration will take, and what the mediums for collaboration are.

#### Part 6: Clients' trigger points

Here, it's about showing a deep understanding of what circumstance/business needs prompt prospects to finally pick up the phone and call for help.

The ability to identify triggers points to the consultancy's deep level of expertise, which, in turn, allows them to identify patterns and common symptoms.

By explaining common trigger points, consultancies help put prospects' minds at ease: "Others experienced similar problems but this consultancy helped them overcome these issues."

#### Part 7: Entry service

Hiring a consultancy is, more often than not, a resource-consuming commitment. Clients need to allocate significant budgets and time. This, understandably, makes prospects hesitant to commit to full-scale partnerships at first.

Consultancies can easily overcome this hesitation by explaining what their entry service entails. A great example of an entry service is an audit/discovery service. It gives the consultancy a chance to explore the parameters of work, determine what the underlying issues are, and create an improvement roadmap. For clients, this is a low-risk start to the cooperation. The client gets valuable insights and a stronger understanding of the capabilities/expertise depth of the consultancy. A win-win.

#### Part 8: Thought leadership pillars

Last but not least is providing a prospect with a concise summary of the theme pillars that the consultancy's thought leadership strategy is based on.

In short, it's about explaining what pain points of the target audience the consultancy tries to address in its educational efforts.

This demonstrates the consultancy's generosity in knowledge-sharing, its deep understanding of the underlying issues that prospects struggle with, and having the necessary expertise to address those issues.

## Examples of applying this consulting template to practice

So how can this template be applied in practice? Here are a couple of examples:

### Example 1: My consultancy – The Visible Authority

1. Why clients contact me

This is what I say:

“Consultancy owners, entrenched in project execution, call me when they hit a revenue or profit ceiling, struggle to grow, and need a trusted advisor to challenge current assumptions. The goal: creating a high-performing consultancy, intentionally crafted rather than spontaneously occurring.”

2. What typical pain points my clients experience

• Unclear positioning: Struggling to define their target audience and address specific pain points

• Limited thought leadership: Difficulty establishing themselves as leading thinkers with a bold perspective

• Lack of focused expertise: Striving to develop and communicate a specific, expertise-led service offering

• Misaligned co-owners: Struggling to unify a cohesive revenue growth strategy

• Inconsistent new client acquisition: Experiencing difficulties attracting new clients predictably, resorting to chasing instead

• Inadequate existing client development and retention: Failing to methodically engineer service expansion for existing clients

• Stagnant scaling: Struggling to develop innovative service offerings, programs and delivery methods, avoiding linear headcount increase

• Inefficient pipeline management: Lacking disciplined and reliable forecasting and pipeline management processes

• Weak infrastructure: Insufficient sales and project management systems in place, limiting overall productivity and efficiencies

• Absence of performance measurement: Struggling to monitor core high-performance indicators consistently

• Difficulty retaining key talent: Experiencing challenges in keeping essential team members engaged and committed

3. My ideal clients

• Mid-sized consultancy firms, +/- 20 to 100 consultants and/or +/- €2M to €25M revenue.

4. What clients walk away with after working with me

• A thorough assessment of their current consultancy's situation, followed by a detailed evaluation that identifies areas of improvement.

• A co-created roadmap and a plan for improvement that addresses critical pain points and aligns with the consultancy’s unique goals and vision for success.

• My implementation guidance over an extended period of time, to provide ‘peace of mind’ for the consultancy owners.

Inevitably, these outcomes will deeply impact long-term revenue and profitability.

5. How can consultancies start working with me

• Every collaboration starts with a foundational assessment followed up by my guidance on the implementation of my improvement recommendations (details on my website)

• You can start with a workshop for consultancy owners, leaders, or partners and start the reflection process within the team

• Consulting owners, leaders, or partners can book an individual guidance package

6. When prospects typically reach out to me

I receive call requests from boutique consultancy owners and leaders when:

• The consultancy's growth has stalled or is on a downward trajectory

• Competitors consistently beat out the consultancy for projects

• Prospects don't get back to the consultancy, requiring multiple followups

• There are constantly price-related negotiations with prospects

• Employees seem to feel unmotivated and burned out

7. My entry service

My engagements with clients almost always start with an audit, which culminates in an improvement roadmap. This provides my clients with a myriad of insights into the underlying issues of their less-than-ideal performance and the steps that they can take to resolve those issues.

8. My thought leadership pillars

I make sure to provide my prospects with as much educational content as I can. The topics I typically cover are business development for boutique consultancies, improving profitability, revenue and profitability growth models, and the impact of positioning on every aspect of running a consulting business.

### Example 2: A boutique marketing automation consultancy

1. Why clients contact this firm

This is what they say:

“Our clients are struggling with maximizing the returns on their marketing investments and are looking to optimize their processes”.

2. What typical pain points the firm’s prospects experience

• There are too many automation solutions on the market, and it’s difficult to figure out which one to go with

• There is a lack of expertise on how to integrate an automation solution into the existing marketing tech stack

• There is a lack of best practices on which solution delivers what sorts of results

• There is a lack of consensus on how to proceed because each team within marketing has its own set of priorities, and there seems to constantly be a lack of alignment.

3. The ideal clients of this firm

• B2B e-commerce companies

4. Typical long-term outcomes of the firm’s work

• A seamlessly integrated marketing automation solution that improves the efficiency of the marketing department by 10-20%

• A change management methodology to ensure 100% organizational adoption of the newly streamlined processes within a 6-month period

5. How can prospects start working with the firm

• Every project starts with an onboarding questionnaire to map out the existing tech stack and bottlenecks

• A typical project lasts for 8-10 weeks, depending on the complexity of the existing infrastructure

• The implementation typically requires bi-weekly 2-hour sessions with the CTO, CMO, and managers of marketing teams.

6. When prospects typically reach out to the consultancy

Prospects typically pick up the phone and call the consultancy when:

• Managing the tech stack starts taking up more time than actually setting up marketing campaigns

• Marketing fails to produce strong results for two quarters in a row, often citing the lack of the right resources and feeling overwhelmed with the volume of tasks

• Competitors seem to be churning out campaigns that get noticed by the right audience

• There is no unified goal and strategy among various departments

7. The entry service of the consultancy

The first step in client engagement is the questionnaire, which is followed by a document produced by the consultancy that outlines the diagnosis: what the bottlenecks are, which teams need to be involved to address the issue, and recommendations for the best way to proceed.

8. The firm's thought leadership pillars

The consultancy makes sure to address the negative outcomes of the lack of an optimized tech stack for B2B e-commerce companies. The content also covers the untapped potential these companies are missing out on by refusing to automate marketing processes and to optimize marketing tech stacks.

### Example 3: A mid-sized sustainability consultancy

1. Why clients contact the firm

This is what they say:

“Our clients are increasingly under the pressure both from within the company and from the outside by regulatory authorities to improve their sustainability practices”.

2. What typical pain points the firm’s prospects experience

• It is practically impossible to figure out which initiatives have any significant results as opposed to greenwashing

• A lack of expertise to calculate the costs of implementing various projects as well as to quantify the results of these projects

• A lack of understanding of what types of sustainability projects will have long-term results, which ones require constant maintenance vs. one-off set-up

3. The ideal clients of this firm

• Healthcare providers: large hospitals and specialized centers

• Educational institutions: universities with a student body size of 5,000 minimum

• Commercial real estate: facilities offering office space with a capacity of 3,000 people minimum

4. Typical long-term outcomes of the firm’s work

• A reduction in the use of non-renewable energy sources by 10% in Year 1 and an additional 25% in Year 2

• A portfolio of sustainability projects broken down by investment level, outcome projections, and duration estimates

• An implementation roadmap that will allow the client to gradually but effectively roll out the set of selected sustainability projects

5. How can prospects start working with the firm

• Every project starts with an in-person or virtual sit-down involving the CEO, CFO, CTO, and COO.

• The duration of the collaboration is typically 6 to 12 months.

• The project is executed in bi-weekly sprints, with each sprint clearly outlined and explained to all stakeholders at the beginning of the collaboration.

6. When prospects typically reach out to the consultancy

Prospects tend to reach out when they face one or more of the following problems:

• They get penalized by government institutions for the failure to comply with relevant environment-related regulations

• They are failing to attract the right talent due to the lack of effective sustainability practices

• Maintaining the current mode of operations is becoming increasingly costly in light of the more efficient technologies and processes available on the market

7. The consultancy's entry service

99% of client engagements commence with an audit of existing processes, technologies, and operations manuals. The audit is concluded with a detailed list of recommendations that the client can execute to significantly improve their status quo.

8. The firm's thought leadership pillars

The consultancy owners and leaders dedicate a significant amount of time to educating their target audience on such topics as:

• Latest innovations in the sustainability space and whether they are worth the hype

• The negative consequences of failing to implement various sustainability initiatives

• The benefits and risks of individual sustainability initiatives/technologies

## In conclusion

There is only so much time consultancies get to make an impression on their prospects when they meet them at a conference or some other networking event.

The truth is, if a consulting leader fails at this first impression, it will be significantly harder to get any positive results down the line.

They can send follow-up emails and try to schedule calls – the prospect is unlikely to be interested if, in the first 1-2 minutes of meeting the consulting leader, he/she bragged about how amazing his/her consulting firm is.

If, on the other hand, consulting leaders spend these first couple of minutes demonstrating their deep understanding of the prototypical pain points that prospects in the same industry/position experience and giving an easy-to-understand explanation of how these pain points can be resolved, these prospects will remember.

They will want to learn more. They will also want to see how they can benefit from the highly focused expertise of the consultancy to reach the “promised land”.

# Why Are Consultancies Appointing New Partners Without a Voice?

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 29 August 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-are-consultancies-appointing-new-partners-without-a-voice

---

In a world dominated by the clamor of opinions, where authority is often equated with the volume of one's voice, a curious phenomenon unfolds behind most boutique consultancies' closed doors.A silent majority is rising to power, a cohort of newly appointed partners who, perplexingly, have no discernible voice in their market. Their LinkedIn profiles are eerily quiet, their expertise domains, if detectable, are not connected to any leading voice, and their authority seems invisible to the naked eye.This raises a perplexing question: Why are existing owners/partners of consultancies appointing such new co-owners or partners who seemingly have no visible authority?There’s no scientific evidence that explains this phenomenon, so I decided to anecdotally turf new partner appointments I get noticed of via several European consulting publications & announcements.

Here are the flabbergasting statistics (by the way, I only checked the mid-market consultancies; no big consulting firms, but their 'problem' is similar):

• I got notified of 253 boutique consultancy partner or co-owner appointments from January 1st till July 2023 (I stopped turfing after July 31)

• I checked out their profiles via the website and social media, and only 6 of those 253 could be considered as ‘Visible Authorities’ in their expertise domain, industry or market.

• Out of those 6, only 2 were real champions. The other 4 were doing ‘quite OK’.

Picture: The inside flap of my notebook - counting the partner appointments in boutique consultancies - January till July 2023

### A real champion?

A real champion is someone who not only possesses deep expertise in their expertise domain, industry, or market but also actively contributes to the discourse, influences trends, and shapes the future of their field. They are thought leaders sought after for their insights, regularly publish articles or reports that are widely read and cited and receive invitations to speak at industry conferences and events. Their authority is not just visible; it is acknowledged and respected by their peers, clients, and competitors alike.In a world where everyone is vying for attention, real champions are the ones whose voices rise above the noise and make a lasting impact.Recommended reading:(Case Study) Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy

## Consultancy owners must set the right example

Let’s return to my statistics: 98% of consultancy owners have nothing to say. Their LinkedIn is ‘empty’.I am always fascinated by the overwhelming majority choosing not to build up their reputation for domain expertise. How will their prospects start to trust them and the expertise of their consultancy? Trust is a crucial element for winning projects and retaining clients. And trust needs to be proven – 'being a partner' or years of experience in the field will not cut it.

I see consultancy owners posting all sorts of useless hodgepodge on LinkedIn – “Look at these pictures of the weekend in the forest we spent as a team and how awesomely it showcases our company’s culture” type.Or the consultancy pays for a few monthly LinkedIn ads that nobody clicks on because they are purely promotional (like all other thousands) and not educational, not inspirational.Here’s the thing. Nobody cares about these weekends, apart from the team (hopefully). Nobody clicks on these ads because of dumb slogans like ‘we unleash the power of your digital transformation’ (which we see hundreds of per week).Most consultancy owners I speak to aspire to be respected authorities. They are dreaming of establishing high demand for their consultancy’s expertise and services. Yet, they refuse to invest time into sharing with prospects their leading thoughts. They don’t think that client education is a priority.That’s some contradictory logic. You can’t have one without the other.And suppose owners of consultancies don’t invest time and energy into growing their reputation as undeniable subject matter authorities. In that case, they, of course, do not have these expectations of consultants that they promote to partners.Recommended reading:5 Reasons Consulting Leaders Are Missing the Digital Train

## It’s not about the lack of time – it’s about the wrong mindset!

"Luk, I don't have time to educate my audience".

Most consultancy owners, partners, and leaders keep telling me that. If I had a penny…Let me be straightforward: the honest answer is that they don't prioritise it. And in the long run, that’s a risky decision in a trust-based consulting space.

> “When consulting business owners say they don’t have time, they are essentially saying: I don’t want to prioritise sustainable business growth and standing out in the market so I can command premium pricing. Without educating your audience, you will never be able to communicate why you are different and worth buying and be on top of the minds of your ideal buyers once they have the need. (Vladimir Blagojević)”

“When consulting business owners say they don’t have time, they are essentially saying: I don’t want to prioritise sustainable business growth and standing out in the market so I can command premium pricing. Without educating your audience, you will never be able to communicate why you are different and worth buying and be on top of the minds of your ideal buyers once they have the need. (Vladimir Blagojević)”

Senior leaders, owners, or partners in a consultancy are the most influential voices to consistently share their leading thoughts on the (specific) expertise of the consultancy.

If they don’t consider this a priority, they will soon be outplayed by their expertise-rich competitor with an abundance of ‘trust stuff’: inspirational, openly shared experiences and leading thoughts.High-performing consultancies took note of the massive shift in how business development in consulting works these days. They understand that they can’t go back and play by the old rules. They generously share their knowledge and drive business development by educating their target audience. They are diligently producing thought leadership that goes to the heart of problems their target audience experiences.Result? They have prospects knocking on their doors. They don’t have to compromise on pricing or submit 20-page proposals to win a bid. Their target market is already aware of this consultancy's high level of expertise because their leaders – owners and partners – are highly reputable authorities in the field.Pitching against such a competitor is a hell of a job!

*Recommended reading:Without Thought Leadership, Consultancies Will Fail*

### Connecting with the C-level

The ultimate success of a boutique consultancy hinges on its ability to forge long-term relationships with clients and position itself as a trusted advisor. This connection is most crucial at the C-level, perhaps even with the CEO, as these are the decision-makers who shape the future of their organizations.

However, this trust is not easily earned. C-level executives are inundated with information and offers from all directions, and to cut through the noise, a consultancy partner must demonstrate not only expertise but also thought leadership.

How can a CEO or C-level executive consider a consultancy partner as a trusted advisor when there is no evidence of leading thinking from that partner?

In a world where a partner's leading thinking is a key currency of trust, the lack of any visible authority from that specific partner can be a significant barrier to forming meaningful, long-term relationships with clients.

### Growth in consulting is rooted in audience education

Here is a message I suggest every boutique consultancy owner and partner internalize: growing a consultancy business, like it or not, is rooted in educating your audience. Consultancies will always struggle to grow sustainably and profitably if that's not a priority.

I want consultancy owners who say they don’t have (read: make) time for this to hear me clearly: audience education is a business P-R-I-O-R-I-T-Y.Sharing the experiences and educating the target audience IS THE JOB OF CONSULTING LEADERS.No deep audience education? Consulting prospects and existing clients will turn to a 'leading-thinker-competitor' (according torecent research, as much as 72%!).And a few quick and dirty chatGPT posts will not cut it – they will just become a part of the noise!

> ​​Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep expertise with their ability to identify patterns, address specific pain points, predict trends, and offer practical advice.

​​Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep expertise with their ability to identify patterns, address specific pain points, predict trends, and offer practical advice.

I urge consultancy owners and leaders to start educating their buyers, showing them best practices, and giving them unique and valuable tips for success. ChatGPT has no clue about that.

By openly sharing expertise, consultancy owners and leaders send a message that they are not afraid to reveal their expertise because they are confident in their skills and knowledge. It sends a powerful message their consultancy has much more to offer because of how freely the firm’s leaders share their knowledge.Consultants who get promoted to partners are expected to step in the shoes of rainmakers. However, that’s simply not feasible without these consultants having a solid reputational footprint for excellence in expertise! What do these firms expect these newly minted partners to do? Pull out a yellow book and start dialling? Or send hundreds of automated direct messages via LinkedIn all of a sudden (that nobody replies to)?For those starting from scratch, here’s how the journey unfolds over time:

• In the beginning, there’s the work OR the client's education.

• Later, it becomes the work AND the client's education.

• Ultimately, the client's education BECOMES the work.

## In conclusion

I write daily on Linkedin - it's the source of 80% of new business opportunities.Writing every day doesn't just fill pages – it ignites my intellectual evolution, making me a sharper thinker and a better advisor to my consultancy clients!Writing daily causes my brain to see ideas everywhere throughout the day. It’s the cross-pollination between my advisory work and capturing ideas, pain points, challenges, processes, methodologies, successes, outcomes, failures, objections, questions, answers, market & technology trends, etc., all day long.Effortlessly! Really.Sharing expertise IS my work! I wouldn't be where I am today without writing and speaking.I hope every single consultancy owner internalizes the modern reality of business development – those who do not have time to educate their audience will find themselves racing to the bottom and competing on pricing.Sharing expertise is THE priority. And that should be expected from those getting partner promotions or appointments in any sort of consultancy.

# Why High-Performance Consultancies Are Obsessed with Specificity

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 17 August 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-high-performance-consultancies-are-obsessed-with-specificity

---

There are two questions that I expect consultancies to be able to answer in under 10 seconds: (1) Who do you work with? (2) What problem do you help them solve?Simple, right?No, as my years of experience have shown me. Rarely do these two questions receive instant, straight-to-the-point answers.It is a lot more common for consulting leaders and owners to either give a generic answer (“We help businesses unleash the power of digital transformation” type) or go on a 10-minute monologue, explaining all the services the consultancy offers.I found that this is often quite symptomatic of the larger issue that these consultancies face – the lack of specificity. I keep seeing a lot of consulting BS.What’s more, it is not uncommon for consultancy owners and their senior leadership to not even realize that they have this problem or that it’s at the root of their business development and revenue growth struggles.That’s what I’d like to discuss in this post – ‘specificity’ in running a consulting business.

## The consulting business quadrant

Imagine a matrix. On the X-axis, we have the problem(s) a consultancy solves. On the Y-axis, we have the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) - the specific audience the consultancy works for.

I call itThe Consultancy Specificity Quadrant. Here is a visual representation of it.

• TheGeneralist Grid(Q1) is where consultancies that offer a wide range of solutions to a broad audience are located.

• TheSpecialist Spectrum(Q2) is those consulting firms that have a narrow range of services but still a broad target audience.

• TheNiche Navigator(Q3) is consultancies that offer a wide range of services but to a highly targeted audience.

• TheExpert Epicenter(Q4) is consulting firms that were able to both narrow down their audience and the services that they offer.

Here are two examples of my former clients.

Example 1: A risk modeling consultancy

This consultancy chose a narrow target audience and a narrow area of expertise. Instead of offering data and analytics like thousands of other firms, it focused on risk modeling services for the banking industry.

Example 2: A sales forecasting consultancy

This particular consultancy started off as a generic data and analytics firm. Over time, it narrowed down its audience to the retail industry – that’s where the majority of its decent-paying clients had been coming from. Additionally, they started paying closer attention to sales forecasting. It’s a need that they noticed across various sectors.Eventually, this consultancy solidified its narrow positioning by becoming highly specific about both the target audience (large supermarket chains) AND the problem they are solving (sales forecast optimization).I’d like to take a closer look at the quadrants.

Quadrant 1: data and analytics. These are generic consulting offerings. There are thousands of consultancy firms of every size that offer data and analytics services. 'Doing data analytics' is too vague. There's no specific audience, no specific problem resolution. It's a wide net cast into an ocean of possibilities, but it's not catching much. I am sure the consultancies in this quadrant play in the pricing rate race with poor margins and a lot of stress.Quadrant 2: data and analytics in retail. Alright, this is slightly better. At least the target audience is more narrow. However, consultancies in this quadrant will still struggle to consistently get new clients, retain them, and grow as a business. They do not have a clear problem area expertise.Quadrant 3: sales and forecasting. Here, consultancy firms have the opposite problem to Quadrant 2. The need that consultancies in this quadrant address is very clear. However, who do they work with? Which industry? Which vertical? Sales forecasting for the financial sector in B2B differs massively from sales forecasting for ecommerce brands in B2C.Quadrant 4: sales forecasting for large supermarket chains. Now these consultancies have a clear need that they address for a very specific audience. Consultants in these firms work with large supermarket chains day in and day out, working on a single problem area – sales forecasting. When a brand like Tesco or Costco is looking for an outside partner to audit their forecasting process or implement new tech stacks into the forecasting process, who will they go with? Quadrant 4 consultancies. Who will they be willing to pay premium fees to? Quadrant 4 consultancies. Why? Because they can showcase the deepest level of expertise in a specific area for a specific audience.

Deep, targeted expertise pays.

> I consider myself as a member of the ‘counterculture of committers’ (a term coined by Pete Davis) who have made it to ‘the other side’: focusing on ONE single expertise domain for a longer period of time (maybe forever), going all the way, building the deepest possible knowledge, mastering and loving my craft.

## Specificity – the road to a high-performance consultancy business

The path to the upper quadrant of consulting success is paved with SPECIFICITY. It's not enough to simply offer a service. A consultancy must understand who needs the service and why.

The more specific boutique consultancy firms can be about their target audience and the problems they solve for this audience, the more value they can provide. And in the world of consultancy, value is king. That’s how mid-sized consultancies can beat the big consulting firms. I’ve been there.I urge consultancies to avoid generic positioning in the sea of competition. Instead, consultancy firms should strive for deep expertise that can help a narrow audience solve a very specific – but highly important – problem.That's how a consultancy can escape the pricing rate race, improve its margins, and reduce stress.

### Service variety versus specificity in consulting

“We love variation in our work” – I’ve heard this more than once from a consulting leader or an owner of a consulting business.Sure, variation is exciting at first. Working with new clients from a new industry, tackling new problems, getting to learn new approaches and technologies. Fun.And then the reality settles in. Variation in consulting does not sell. C-level executives are not interested in paying premium fees for consultancy firms to “learn as they go”. They want to work with THE experts – those who can expertly diagnose a problem and create a fool-proof plan on how to overcome the problem.This type of expertise comes from focus, from working with the same type of clients on the same types of problems every single day.

> Most consultants tend to operate from a fear-based mindset, which causes them to take almost any work that pays and keeps their options open so they don't miss out on potential income or revenue. This reactive thinking actually strengthens the risk of remaining in mediocrity.

Most consultants tend to operate from a fear-based mindset, which causes them to take almost any work that pays and keeps their options open so they don't miss out on potential income or revenue. This reactive thinking actually strengthens the risk of remaining in mediocrity.

*Recommended reading:Why Variation in Consulting Does Not SellAnd that’s why the most successful mid-sized consultancies I’ve worked with or observed – the high-performance consultancies – are obsessed with expertise depth.*

In my article,Furiously Successful Consultancies Put All Their Eggs in One Basket, I explain why a narrow focus pays off big time.The TL;DR version is: the stronger and more relevant the expertise, the more value a consultancy can deliver, which, in turn, translates into premium fees.Operational costs go down due to the optimization of processes over time. The consultancy’s reputation gradually expands, bringing down the costs of marketing and business development. Project pipelines become more manageable and easier to forecast. Margins increase.

### Variety within specificity in consulting

Furthermore, I do want to address the common misconception that specificity – or a narrow focus – means a lack of variety in services.I will use the example of the Quadrant 4 consultancy firm from earlier – a specialist retail analytics consultancy that offers one main service: sales forecasting for large supermarket chains. This is a real consultancy – one of my past clients.This consultancy, over time, developed a vertical range of underlying, connected services derived from the narrow focus (to name a few):

• store inventory management

• shopper segmentation

• pricing optimization

• store layout optimization

• fraud and theft detection analytics

You see, all these services revolve around their foundational expertise – using data to predict sales.However, there is certainly variety in their service offering. The difference between their service variety and the royal buffet of services offered by generalist consultancy firms? They can effortlessly upsell a single client for all these services.They still cater to the same niche market: large supermarket chains. These services make it easier to create multiple-year collaboration journeys, to set up long-term retainer-based contracts, and to generate recurring revenue from existing clients at premium prices.These ‘connected services’ are designed to work together to address a specific need of the client within an area of expertise. Their services are not stand-alone but rather a comprehensive, overarching approach that (vertically) addresses multiple aspects of a specific problem of a specific client.Here’s a visual that shows the distinction between Q1 and Q4 consultancies:

## In conclusion

What I’ve learned the past decade is that high-performance consultancies can much better escape the stress of always hunting for new clients and competing based on pricing through specificity – by focusing on a specific area of expertise that will have a narrowly defined audience solve a high-impact (expensive) problem.This focus enables these consultancy firms to provide more effective and efficient solutions, which will lead to more satisfied clients, better client development and long-term retention, improved reputation, targeted marketing and sales efforts, inspirational thought leadership, and more opportunities for business growth.And what I’ve seen time and time again: repetition of similar projects (due to more specificity in positioning) leads to smooth internal knowledge transfer and cost-effective streamlining/automation of returning processes (with the opportunity to create some serious IP) and scaling without linear headcount growth. Plus, as I have experienced time and time again, these specificity-obsessed firms usually beat the big consultancy firms for client bids due to their deep – and oftentimes unmatched – expertise.All leading to, what I always consider as the holy grail in consulting: more revenue stability, healthy (above market) gross margins, and a better quality of life for everyone in the consultancy.

# The Golden Triangle of Success High-Performing Boutique Consultancies Swear By

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

---

In the last few years, I’ve had a chance to audit dozens of consulting firms – primarily small and medium-sized consultancies.No matter how often I see it, one of the observations that still amazes me is the variation in gross margins between high-performing boutique consultancies and the average, growing-on-paper-in-terms-of-revenue firms.I’ve audited consultancies that boasted gross margins as high as 80% (!!) and worked with firms that post 20-25% gross margins.I always use my work with highly successful consultancies as a learning opportunity – I pay close attention to identifying factors that differentiate them from struggling firms. What do they do differently?I aggregate these learnings to spot patterns. While, of course, there are unique characteristics that contribute to the success of these consulting firms, the foundational elements, by and large, are strikingly similar.

## The golden triangle of consultancy success

At the foundation of their business success, high-performing consultancies are excelling in the following three aspects:

• Narrow focus

• Repetition of similar projects

• Pattern recognition

I’ll elaborate on each briefly.

### 1. A narrow focus sets out the parameters for knowledge depth

My regular readers know – I’m an avid advocate of a narrow focus in consulting. I believe that true value for clients can only be created by consultancies once they become highly knowledgeable in a specific domain.It’s the type of knowledge depth that most other consultancies would find hard to compete with. This depth allows consultants in these firms to diagnose clients’ problems precisely and efficiently to create implementation roadmaps that perfectly fit their clients' organizational and industry contexts.It’s the type of expertise that helps clients see tangible results – be it sustainable growth, a significant reduction in costs, exponentially faster processes, or undeniably higher profits.This level of expertise enables consultancies to charge premium fees – 2-3x higher than their competitors. Why? Because the value of their work is exponentially higher as well.And such expertise depth is impossible without a consultancy sticking to a narrow focus in its work – both in terms of the pain points it addresses for clients and what type of clients it works with.Recommended reading:Why High-Performance Consultancies Are Obsessed with Specificity

### 2. A narrow focus enables repetition in consulting work

The second aspect high-performing consultancies excel at is repetition. Due to the narrow expertise domain focus, they continuously take on the same types of projects from clients in the same domain, accumulating hundreds of hours performing similar tasks.

This repetition allows them to (1) further deepen their expertise and (2) optimize systems and processes. There are no inefficiencies. Every client onboarding process goes off without a hitch. Every marketing campaign delivers high ROIs. Every tech stack is perfectly set up and utilized. Every consultant has a predictable pipeline of work. Every resource is planned out ahead of time.As a result, over time, the costs go significantly down. The value of work, due to expertise getting continuously deepened, goes up over time, on the other hand. As a result, gross margins and net profits grow.Such consultancies can avoid tying their business growth to headcount growth. Instead, they look for opportunities inside their existing narrow focus.“But Luk, repetition is boring!”Really? Is building an incredible depth of expertise and developing a powerhouse for business performance in a consultancy boring? Kidding me?Variation and a scattered (horizontal) service offering in consulting rarely work. I’ve repeatedly seen consultancies saying yes to all incoming opportunities, diluting their expertise, and competing with thousands of other consultancies on pricing. These firms do not have a reputational footprint for deep expertise. Their business development and marketing campaigns yield poor results. Consultants’ time is not managed in any predictable, stable manner. The result? Sub-par margins and a constant existential health struggle.

Variation is exciting at first. I get that. But to be honest, it’s wearing off over time. Then, fatigue hits the road. The excitement of new projects, new types of clients, and acquiring new skills eventually loses ground to the frustration and stress of not having a reliable pipeline of work.

> High-performing consultancies fiercely protect their narrow expertise because they know this is their differentiating factor. It’s the foundation of their success. They will never dream of diluting that.

High-performing consultancies fiercely protect their narrow expertise because they know this is their differentiating factor. It’s the foundation of their success. They will never dream of diluting that.

### 3. Repetition leads to pattern recognition

A consultancy business's true value is rooted in the power of pattern recognition – much like in science, research, or medical practice.

Just as a researcher discerns patterns in data, a medical specialist diagnoses conditions from symptomatic patterns, or a scientist makes discoveries from repeated experimentation, a consultancy derives differentiating expertise by undertaking similar projects repetitively.This repetition enables consultancies to spot patterns and make accurate predictions. This is the level of expertise that average consultancies with a diversified portfolio of services will never be able to achieve.Being able to recognize patterns allows consultancies to spot symptoms and provide a diagnosis to their clients with laser-like precision. This, in turn, enables these consulting firms to create a perfect “treatment” – a roadmap that will lead their clients from a pain-ridden state to the “promised land”.These implementation plans deliver on the promises – they allow clients to see significant changes for the better. This is how these boutique consultancies grow their reputation footprint – they have case studies, benchmarks and referrals that point to the unmatched expertise that allows them to deliver results that very few other consultancies in that domain can compete with.Result? Prospects start knocking on their door. Business development and sales costs become negligent. Marketing is focused on amplifying the reputational footprint of the consultancy and its owners/partners.

> I’ve learned in the past decade that high-performing consultancies can much better escape the stress of always hunting for new clients and competing based on pricing through specificity – by focusing on a specific area of expertise that will have a narrowly defined audience solve a high-impact (expensive) problem.

## In conclusion

The golden triangle – narrow focus, repetition, and pattern recognition – acts as a catalyst, turning ‘raw expertise’ into invaluable insights, elevating the consultancy’s efficiency, reducing the variability in processes and improving the predictability of outcomes.Needless to say, this ‘boring triangle’ offers unique perspectives, data, benchmarks, and evidence-based, differentiating advice to clients.Clients love that.I urge consultancies still in the old-school world of offering many services to think again! The golden triangle should become every boutique consultancy’s ambition.Because I’ve witnessed it repeatedly: it ALWAYS leads to higher client satisfaction, stronger customer relationships, increased demand for services, and premium pricing.In the end, the consultancy's bottom line and the owner’s or partner’s quality of life will be positively impacted.

# Why Vertical Service Integration Is the Future of Growth for Boutique Consultancies

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 02 August 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-vertical-service-integration-is-the-future-of-growth-for-boutique-consultancies

---

It's time to bury the old-school, linear growth model in the boutique consultancy.A linear growth model in consulting is one where revenue growth is directly proportional to headcount growth.Usually, boutique founder-led consultancies start with a narrow focus. It’s often created by a small group of consultants with deep expertise – technical SAP consultants, social media advertising specialists, growth marketing consultants, data analytics specialists, or supply chain experts – you name it.As the team starts to grow, founders begin entertaining the idea of expanding the services offered by their consultancy. It’s pretty standard. I’ve been there myself.So they start hiring more consultants to take on the expanded services. Before they know it, they now offer everything to everyone.

### We live in the labour shortage era.

It’s a slippery slope. And I strongly advise boutique consultancies against it. In a talent-scarce, hypercompetitive arena, consultancies can’t really afford to link revenue growth with headcount growth.Not to mention the hit that consultancies tend to take in terms of profitability because of the expanded services. As a specialized firm with deep expertise and a strong reputation in the market, a consultancy could charge premium prices.However, the more unrelated services are added, the more diluted the reputational footprint of the consultancy becomes, the less impactful marketing and business development efforts get, the more competition waits around every corner, and the higher the pricing pressure gets. And three years later: the total disintegration of the original consultancy concept.

> “The variation in consulting work is exciting at first. I get that. But to be honest, it’s wearing off over time. Then, fatigue hits the road. A narrow focus is maybe boring at first but becomes more exciting over time. People start inviting the expert consultancy that knows (almost) everything, has the most compelling data, can spot intriguing patterns, explain fascinating solutions, gets admired for thought-provoking ideas, and doesn’t need to sell or convince."

It's time to confront the uncomfortable truth and transform how we grow in a boutique consultancy. Let’s leave the linear headcount growth to the big consulting firms (who also continue to rethink their leverage models).My favorite approach is vertical service integration, in this post, I’ll explain why through the use of two case studies of consultancy clients of mine.

## Linear vs non-linear (vertical service integration) growth models for boutique consultancies

The linear growth model – known as “the leverage model” in consulting – ties revenue to headcount. Headcount growth is needed to grow the revpaymentnd payroll costs increase linearly. Project margins either remain the same or slowly deteriorate.Making (overly diverse) revenue growth dependent on the headcount means endlessly recruiting the right talent. It means constantly having to onboard new consultants. The competition for talent is ruthless, and onboarding often becomes a high cost in these consulting firms.Furthermore, a consultancy that hires employees to expand its diverse service offering horizontally will always have difficulty with knowledge transfer. There simply isn’t enough focused repetition of processes and approaches to create a knowledge bank that can be quickly passed down to the next employee.

### Vertical integration, avoiding the ‘hire to scale battle’

The ‘hire to scale battle’ is something vertically integrated boutique consultancies don’t have to worry about. ​​This model is one of the most powerful methodologies to avoid the ‘hire to scale’ battle.Here’s my definition of vertical integration in consulting."Vertical service integration in consulting refers to the strategic expansion of services within a specific domain of expertise. It's about progressively deepening the consultancy's service offering, providing a spectrum of solutions that span from broad strategic advice to highly specialized, granular interventions. This approach cultivates richer expertise, enables a more comprehensive service to clients, and fosters a deeper understanding of the patterns, intricacies and nuances within a particular field."Instead of diversifying the offering to increase the pool of prospects (horizontally), high-performing consultancies diversify their offerings through depth (vertically) by identifying additional services that can be provided to the same small pool of prospects within the same pain-resolution field.

Due to the narrow focus of their work, these consultancies tend to have well-documented processes. They spend less time on proposal writing, have a better deal closing rate and speed, are more adept at creating experience-based thought leadership, and, ultimately, have more effective and efficient operations and service delivery.

> "In working with consultancies week after week, I am realizing more and more that the extraordinary success of some of those consultancies is directly determined by how narrow they were able to make their focus."

"In working with consultancies week after week, I am realizing more and more that the extraordinary success of some of those consultancies is directly determined by how narrow they were able to make their focus."

Within this vertical service integration model, there are many ways to go. Some diversify through retainer or subscription-based products. Some productize or package repetitive consulting processes and sell them as an add-on. Others offer services that would be ‘the next natural step’ in their work with clients once the initial project is completed.Whichever new revenue stream these consultancies create, they are strongly connected – and sometimes even dependent – on the core offerings within the narrow area of expertise.Recommended reading:Why 'Hiring to Scale' Is a Losing Battle for Mid-sized Consultancies

## Case study #1: A boutique consultancy specializing in sales forecasting for large international supermarket chains

I had the pleasure of working with a boutique consultancy that carved out its niche in the data and analytics space.

This is a highly competitive space – thousands of data analytics consulting firms are out there. This consultancy, however, wasn’t interested in competing for every data and analytics project out there.The co-founders decided to, instead, utilize their experience in sales forecasting to make that the foundation of the consultancy’s offering.However, they didn’t stop there. They decided to focus exclusively on catering to multinational supermarket chains. They strategically decided to develop all their processes around this segment of prospects, perfect their pitches to these prospects, design a highly outcomes-driven service offering around it, and put all their marketing and business development efforts into cornering this market segmentation.Important information: the whole process of narrowing down the focus and verticalization took almost three years. Step by step, without destroying the revenue from other work streams (that gradually faded out).This firm became highly profitable. Their process repetition allowed for the optimization of resources, making them extremely efficient. As the expertise level deepened – again, by working with the same types of clients on resolving the same pain point day in and day out – their offering became more valuable, allowing them to charge exponentially higher fees than other consultancies.Whenever the co-founders felt that it was time to grow and diversify the service offering, instead of expanding the services to capture other types of clients – say fashion retailers or large e-commerce brands – they thought of what additional services they could develop for large international supermarket chains within the pain point of sales forecasting.So, over time, this consultancy developed a vertical range of underlying, connected services derived from the narrow focus of sales forecasting for large international supermarkets.

### Here’s an overview of the vertical integration model

• Sales Forecasting (the foundational service): This primary service leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to predict future sales patterns of supermarkets. It accounts for factors such as historical sales data, seasonal trends, promotional activities, and wider market dynamics. By providing accurate sales forecasts, supermarkets can make informed decisions on inventory management, pricing, marketing strategies, and overall business planning. This service forms the foundation of the consultancy's vertical integration model, setting the stage and the data sources for the more specialized underlying services.

• Store Inventory Management: This service optimizes inventory levels based on forecasted sales, ensuring supermarkets have the right amount of each product at the right time to meet customer demand without overstocking.

• Shopper Segmentation: This service uses sales forecasting data to identify distinct shopper groups based on buying behaviour and preferences, allowing supermarkets to better cater to the needs of different customer segments.

• Pricing Optimization: This service uses forecasted sales data and shopper segmentation insights to develop dynamic pricing strategies, maximizing profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction.

• Store Layout Optimization: Based on sales forecasting and shopper segmentation data, this service advises on optimal store layouts to enhance the shopper experience and maximize sales of various product categories.

• Fraud and Theft Detection Analytics: This service leverages the discrepancies between forecasted and actual sales to identify potential instances of fraud or theft, providing supermarkets with insights to mitigate losses and improve security.

These five underlying services, derived from their primary sales forecasting expertise, allow the consultancy to provide more comprehensive and customised solutions to their supermarket clients. This deepened expertise enhances their value proposition and supports their highly profitable vertical service integration model.

### The most significant advantages this consultancy has learned over the years (same learnings in case study #2)

• Upselling: Not only were they able to attract new clients within their suite of integrated services, but their success rate for upselling to existing clients also went through the roof. By establishing trust with their clients with the initial sales forecast project by delivering high-value results, they barely have to convince their clients to start the journey through their other integrated offerings. As a result, this consultancy’s current marketing and business development expenses are almost negligible. Growth is all about upselling in the vertical model.

• Multiple-year collaborations: The upselling within the vertical service model with existing clients has enabled them to upsell a single client for all their services effortlessly and has already created several multiple-year collaboration contracts with stable, recurring revenue from existing clients at premium prices.

• Non-linear growth: By rigorously implementing its vertical service integration, the consultancy has ingeniously uncoupled revenue growth from headcount expansion. By emphasizing and cultivating depth of knowledge in a strategic, interconnected manner, they've transformed how growth is achieved, reducing reliance on team size and instead leveraging their deep-seated expertise.

## Case study #2: A boutique consultancy specializing in supply chain risk management in manufacturing

The second case study that perfectly represents the growth potential of the vertical service integration growth model is a supply chain boutique consultancy – another former client of mine. They are a group of daring supply chain leaders (a mix of former Big 4 consultants and supply chain execs) solely focused on supply chain risk.

Like in the first case study, when it was time to grow the consultancy, the co-founders threw out the age-old linear growth model in favour of vertical service integration. Their focus isn't on expanding the team; it's about deepening their supply chain risk expertise and offering an interconnected suite of services that move from global to granular.

> "In consulting…Narrow focus is the path to repetition.Repetition is the path to expertise.Expertise is the path to value.Value is the path to profit.Profit is the path to quality of life."

"In consulting…Narrow focus is the path to repetition.Repetition is the path to expertise.Expertise is the path to value.Value is the path to profit.Profit is the path to quality of life."

### Here’s their vertical ‘risk cascade’

• Supply chain risk management: At the top of their vertical cascade is the holistic approach to supply chain risk management. By looking at the big picture, they're helping businesses navigate the labyrinth of global logistics, ensuring every part of the supply chain is robust & resilient.

• Supply risk management: Delving deeper, they zoom in on specific supply risks to optimise operations.

• Supplier risk management: Further down the vertical integration, they scrutinise every supplier relationship. They don't just evaluate potential partners; they aim to transform risk into reliability, guaranteeing sustainable collaborations.

• Supply contract risk management: Finally, they tackle contract risk management at the deepest level of their vertical model. This isn't just about avoiding legal hitches but safeguarding the client's interests.

## In conclusion

Unfortunately, based on my observations of 200+ boutique consulting firms, most jump wider instead of deeper.Life in these (horizontally) diversified boutique consultancies is often problematic from financial health and quality of life standpoint. The pressure on each consultant and marketer to sell, sell, sell is enormous. I’ve encountered too many cases of consultancies’ founders feeling burnt out and noticing an unhealthy, overstressed culture in their teams.Not to mention, it requires tremendous efforts, including constantly hiring people with all kinds of expertise and a lot of training time for these people (if you can find them). They might grow on paper, but each step in this linear growth model comes at increasingly unjustified costs and stress.I won’t argue that vertical service integration is the only growth model for boutique consultancies. However, it has a blueprint that I’ve seen consultancies utilize with fantastic success rates. And that’s worth considering.

Remember: diving deeper rather than wider is a proven success formula.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does a boutique consultancy determine when it's the right time to transition from a linear growth model to vertical service integration, especially considering the potential risks and challenges involved in such a shift?

Determining the right timing for transitioning from a linear growth model to vertical service integration in a boutique consultancy involves a nuanced evaluation of various factors. Firstly, it requires a thorough understanding of the consultancy's current market position, client base, and growth trajectory. Additionally, assessing the scalability of existing services, identifying emerging market trends, and evaluating the competition are crucial aspects. Moreover, internal factors such as team capabilities, operational efficiency, and financial stability play a significant role in this decision-making process. Ultimately, the decision to transition should align with the consultancy's long-term strategic goals and its ability to effectively capitalize on the opportunities presented by vertical service integration.

### While you provide detailed case studies showcasing the success of vertical service integration, what are some common pitfalls or obstacles that boutique consultancies might encounter when implementing this growth model, and how can they mitigate these challenges?

While vertical service integration can offer substantial benefits, it's essential for boutique consultancies to be aware of potential challenges and pitfalls that may arise during implementation. Common obstacles include the need for substantial investment in redefining processes and skill development, managing client expectations during the transition phase, and maintaining consistency in service quality across diversified offerings. Moreover, maintaining a cohesive organizational culture and effectively communicating the value proposition of vertical integration to clients are critical. To mitigate these challenges, consultancies should adopt a phased approach to implementation, prioritize internal training and skill development, foster open communication channels with clients, and continuously monitor and adapt their strategies based on market feedback.

### You emphasize the importance of depth over breadth in service offerings. However, how can boutique consultancies balance the need for specialization with the potential demand from clients for a broader range of services, especially in highly competitive markets?

Balancing specialization with client demand for a broader range of services requires a strategic approach that prioritizes depth of expertise while also addressing client needs effectively. Consultancies can achieve this balance by leveraging client feedback and market research to identify complementary service offerings that align with their core expertise. Additionally, maintaining flexibility in service delivery models, such as offering customizable solutions or strategic partnerships with specialized providers, can help meet diverse client requirements without diluting the consultancy's core focus. Moreover, effective communication and education of clients about the benefits of specialized services can help differentiate the consultancy in a competitive landscape while also ensuring client satisfaction and long-term partnerships.

# Evaluating and Improving Performance of the Founder-Led Boutique Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 04 July 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/evaluating-and-improving-performance-of-the-founder-led-boutique-consultancy

---

In an increasingly complex and competitive business landscape, founder-led boutique consultancies face unique challenges and opportunities.These firms, characterized by their specialized expertise and nimble structures, are perfectly positioned to provide differentiating solutions to their clients. However, they require ongoing, strategic assessment and improvement to harness their potential and maximize performance truly.In this article, I delve into a comprehensive evaluation framework perfected over the years of advising and guiding such consultancy firms toward success.Drawing from first-hand experience and a deep understanding of the industry dynamics, I've created an approach that spotlights the key areas integral to the health and prosperity of these consultancy firms.Through this lens, I aim to give consultancy owners a fresh perspective and a roadmap to assessing and boosting the performance of their boutique consultancies. Here, I share the critical components of this assessment.

## The assessment, Part 1: The desk research before meeting with the new client

#### 1. Positioning Specificity in the market

The first step of my evaluation focuses on the firm's positioning in the market.

This encompasses how effectively the consultancy identifies its target audience, establishes its expertise, and stands out amidst competitors. I look for clarity and distinctiveness in their market positioning, which often reflects a solid strategic foundation.

#### 2. Differentiating Value Proposition

Next, I assess the consultancy's unique value proposition. This involves examining what they promise to deliver to clients and, more importantly, how this offering sets them apart from others.

I delve into their value proposition's uniqueness, relevance, and compelling nature, crucial in attracting and retaining clientele.

#### 3. Visibility and Reputation in the Market

My evaluation continues with an analysis of the firm's visibility and reputation. This includes their presence in relevant media outlets, their standing within industry networks, and overall market recognition.

I consider their online and offline reputation, assessing how effectively they are perceived and known within their field.

#### 4. Thought Leadership Quality, Consistency, and Distribution

I also assess the firm's thought leadership efforts, investigating the quality, consistency, and distribution of its content. This includes reviewing articles, blogs, reports, presentations, webinars, and other content with an eye for authority and value.

The firm's ability to consistently generate insightful and impactful content is vital to establishing credibility, fostering client trust, creating a robust inbound motion and, as a result, reducing the cost of sales (COS).

As I always say: ‘Business development in consulting is rooted in educating the target audience’.

#### 5. Social Proof: Outcome-Based Client Testimonials and Case Studies

Finally, I evaluate the firm's social proof, focusing on outcome-based testimonials and case studies. These elements provide evidence of the firm's ability to deliver on its promises and generate successful client outcomes.

I review these testimonies and case studies for their authenticity, the significance of their results, and the breadth of successful client engagements they represent.

## The assessment, Part 2: Strategic review with the owner(s)

Part 2 of the assessment, "Strategic Review," is integral to my evaluation process. This phase involves a deeper dive into the consultancy's broader strategic framework, building upon the preliminary desk research I conduct before meeting with the client.

With the help of my proprietary business review questionnaire, I assess the firm's long-term goals, responsiveness to industry trends, opportunities for growth, and potential risks that could impact performance.The review includes revisiting my desk research outcomes: the consultancy's market positioning, value proposition, visibility, reputation, thought leadership, and social proof, positioning these aspects within a larger strategic context.This holistic overview enables me to evaluate how well the firm understands and addresses the big picture and the degree of internal alignment among its founders, owners, or leaders on the strategic agenda.

#### Misaligned owners, a frequent challenge

Throughout my years advising consultancy owners, I've observed a recurring theme that threatens the long-term sustainability of boutique consultancy businesses: 'the illusion of internal alignment'.

In the meeting room, agreements are made, nods are shared, and a sense of unified direction is seemingly reached amongst the owners. However, once the meeting ends, each owner often reverts to their individual path, driven by their very own strategy interpretation. This leads to disjointed actions that dilute the consultancy's coherence and impact.This lack of genuine internal alignment among owners not only limits growth and undermines stability; it also poses a severe risk to team morale and cohesion. In an environment where the leadership isn't synchronized, the consulting team may face mixed messages, fragmented objectives, and a lack of clear direction, leading to confusion, dissatisfaction, and, eventually, increased retention risks.

It's not a good thing in this labour shortage era.The challenge for owners, then, extends beyond reaching agreements. They must also foster a culture of shared understanding, commitment, and consistent execution within their teams. A strong, aligned leadership not only guides a consultancy's strategic direction but also sets the foundation for a motivated, engaged, and high-performing team.

### The main KPIs of Part 2

Important note: In evaluating a consultancy's financial and operational performance, I go beyond just reviewing the current numbers. Depending on the firm's history and available data, I carefully analyzetrendsover the past several months or even years.This historical review offers invaluable insights into the firm's trajectory, growth patterns, and responses to past challenges or opportunities. Understanding these dynamics enables a richer and more nuanced evaluation of the firm's health and potential.

Moreover, it helps to identify areas of strength to build upon and areas of concern that need more focused attention or strategic adjustment.Therefore, this part of my assessment adds depth and context to the firm's current performance metrics. Now, I'll review the key performance indicators I think of in this process...

#### 1. Revenue (of course)

The starting point of my financial assessment is the firm's revenue. I examine the total income generated from client engagements to gauge the firm's financial health and market performance.

I look for trends in revenue growth, as this can indicate the consultancy's effectiveness in attracting and retaining clients, as well as the value clients derive from their services.

Revenue generation in a consultancy isn't a straightforward task. It's a delicate balancing act between acquiring new clients, nurturing existing relationships, and delivering a compelling value proposition. Each factor is an essential piece of the puzzle, and mismanaging just one can disrupt the entire revenue ecosystem.

In my revenue assessment, I aim to unravel how effectively a consultancy navigates this intricate balance, as it reveals not only the potential for more significant revenue but also the resilience, reliability, and sustainability of the consultancy.

*Recommended reading:The Negative Impact of Obsessive Revenue Focus in Consulting*

#### 2. Revenue per Full-Time Employee (FTE)

Some might be surprised as to why I am assessing Revenue/FTE.

First, I own quite a bit of benchmark data, of course, always with the risk of comparing apples with pears. But it consistently gives me an immediate indication of the power of the entire team. I've seen immense differences for similar consulting activities, varying from 75k to 450k Euro average revenue per FTE. It tells a lot.

Second, to better understand the firm's financial health, the revenue generated per full-time employee helps me identify the team's productivity and efficiency and can reveal insights about workload and expertise ‘distribution’ within the consultancy, know-how transfer, and staff utilization.

*Recommended reading:Utilization or Demotivation? The Hidden Cost Consultancies Pay When Chasing Billable Hours*

#### 3. Gross Margin (and detail per client, per project, pre and post-project)

A crucial part of my assessment involves analyzing the firm's gross margin – overall and detailed per client, project, and pre and post-project. This gross margin analysis can easily spot the difference between a thriving and a non-thriving consultancy.As I always say: 'The gross margin says it all'. It's a reflection of how effectively and efficiently a consultancy is managed.The reality is that most consultancies go with the flow when managing gross margins. They may track it as an ad-hoc thing or ignore it altogether. Gross margin per client, per project, and the difference between the proposal-based margin and the final post-project margin? Only 5-10% of the consultancies I meet are tracking it.

I’ve been there myself in my early years. But I’ve learned how vital gross margins are (gross margin = total project revenue minus total project-related payroll cost).The truth is, it's one of the most important metrics to track to ensure long-term consultancy health because there are a lot of difficult-to-cure margin eaters, such as:

• too low pricing or heavy discounting to improve win rates

• poor resource management

• ineffective project and scope management

• an excessive amount of revenue from freelancers and contractors (the markup on their fees has a negative margin impact)

• an over-reliance on low-margin projects (hitting the downstream project wall and no plan to move to upstream, higher-margin advisory work)

• a lack of investment in technology and infrastructure (to improve efficiency, allowing the acceptance of more projects and generating more margin)

• to name a few…

*Recommended reading:(Case Study) How This Consultancy Cut Back 30% of Its Services Yet Improved Profitability*

#### 4. Number of Projects, Project Size (in revenue and hours):

I delve into the number of projects the firm undertakes and the size of these projects in terms of revenue and hours.

This examination reveals essential patterns related to client challenges, the firm's capacity to manage multiple projects, and the size and scope of work they can effectively handle.

An overflow of new projects and clients may appear as a sign of success, but it often signals a hidden struggle: a lack of depth in developing existing clients (see also parts 3 and 4).

This continuous churn can strain business development efforts, escalating new client acquisition and onboarding stress.

In essence, a consultancy's ability to manage project volume and cultivate enduring client relationships is a vital gauge of its operational health and long-term sustainability.

*Recommended reading:Getting Over 'The Project Wall' To Grow A Consultancy Firm*

#### 5. Pricing Strategy

Finally, I assess the firm's pricing strategy. I examine whether their pricing model aligns with the value they deliver, market expectations, and the firm's financial goals.

This evaluation helps to determine if the consultancy's pricing strategy is competitive and sustainable in the long run.

In my experience, it's all too common to find that boutique consultancies lack a formalized pricing strategy. Many are caught in the flow of the market tide, adjusting their rates based on client expectations or competitors' pricing.

This approach, while convenient, is far from ideal. It risks undervaluing their expertise, leaving money on the table, and creating inconsistency in perceived value.

A well-defined and implemented pricing strategy, on the other hand, is instrumental in asserting the consultancy's value proposition and driving sustainable profitability.

## The assessment, Part 3: Understanding the power in the sale

The third dimension of my assessment focuses on "Understanding the Power in the Sale". In this crucial part of the evaluation, I explore the interplay between the firm's visibility, reputation, expert-led positioning, thought leadership efforts, and their impact on the sales process.Firms with strong market presence and credibility often have an inherent advantage, giving them more power in the sales process. This advantage manifests in various ways, from lowering new client acquisition costs and enhancing win rates to reducing the sales cycle time and decreasing the volume of discounts offered.However, understanding and harnessing this power requires a nuanced evaluation. That's why I'd like to delve into how I assess this power and the significant benefits it can bring to the consultancy…

### The main KPIs of Part 3

#### 1. New Client Generation

The first KPI in this assessment component is new client generation.

I look into how effectively the consultancy attracts new clients, an essential metric for growth and sustainability. This measurement offers insights into the effectiveness of the firm's marketing and networking strategies and the appeal and relevance of its value proposition.

For those who know me, I always ask: 'Why exactly are prospects calling the consultancy?'

Most of the time, I get troublesome answers from founders/owners. Their answers are not always to the point, an essential indicator of a flaw in positioning and value proposition design.

• A Business Development Template Consultancies Can Use to Introduce Their Firms

#### 2. State of the Pipeline

Next, I focus on the state of the firm's sales pipeline. This involves evaluating the quantity and the quality of potential clients at various stages of the sales process. I scrutinize the firm's pipeline management practices and the ability to forecast future revenue as accurately as possible.A well-managed pipeline that reliably forecasts revenue trends indicates a disciplined approach to sales and can suggest stability in the consultancy's financial future.

This robustness in the pipeline often signals a healthy potential for future revenue and strong market demand for the consultancy's services.

*Recommended reading:The Way a Consultancy Manages Its Pipeline Is the Way It Manages the Consultancy*

#### 3. Cost of Acquisition

I evaluate the cost of sales or client acquisition. This metric encompasses all costs associated with securing a new client - from marketing expenses to the time invested in proposals and negotiations.

In my role as a consultancy advisor, I've observed that the cost of acquisition is not only a reflection of effective business development processes and strategies but also a barometer of the consultancy's reputation, demand for its expertise, competitive landscape, and the power of its thought leadership.

This nuanced understanding of the cost of acquisition KPI can provide a more holistic picture of a consultancy's market position and business development efficiency.

#### 4. Number of Opportunities, Number of Proposals as a Result

I delve into the number of business opportunities the firm identifies and the resulting proposals it generates.

This helps gauge the firm's proactiveness in seeking new business and the efficiency in converting prospects into potential engagements.

#### 5. Average Deal Closing Time

The average time it takes for the firm to close a sale is another critical metric I analyze.

Faster closing times can indicate strong demand, effective sales techniques, and the persuasive power of the firm's expertise and value proposition.

Believe it or not, this KPI, together with the win rate ratio (see following KPI), always gives me an excellent picture of the resonance of the value proposition and the expertise in the market.

Over the years, I've collaborated with a broad spectrum of consultancies. Some exhibit impressive agility, clinching deals within 4 to 6 weeks, while others navigate a more complex sale process, extending their closing time to as long as 6 months.

These disparities aren't just arbitrary numbers; they indicate the consultancy's strategic positioning and reputation, the nature of its service offerings, and its overall market dynamics.

Unpacking these nuances always offers me valuable insights.

#### 6. Win Rates

I examine the firm's win rates, i.e., the percentage of proposals that result in a successful engagement. Strong power in the sale should typically translate into high win rates, often in the region of >70-80%.

Strong win rates suggest the consultancy's competitive strength and its ability to (more) easily convince potential clients of the value it delivers.

Suppose win rates are below 30-40%. In that case, it may point towards a need to reevaluate market positioning, value proposition, social proof (other clients telling about their outcomes), and maybe even the entire business development and proposal approach.

Win rates reflect the consultancy's market appeal, so I don't take these numbers lightly.

Recommended post:Do you know your consultancy proposal win rates tell a compelling story?

#### 7. New Client Ratio (New versus Existing Clients)

An essential dimension of my evaluation centres around the consultancy's client mix, particularly the ratio of new clients to existing ones. This ratio serves as a litmus test of the firm's dual capacity to nurture enduring relationships while continuing to attract fresh engagements. While a 30:70 ratio of new to existing clients is generally desirable, the optimal balance can vary depending on the consultancy's expertise.The trend lines are key here, more so than static figures. For instance, while initially encouraging, a sharp uptick in new clients could indicate potential issues. These may include imminent capacity constraints with the challenges of onboarding, managing, and delivering value to an expanding new client base or difficulty retaining existing clients over an extended period.This deeper insight calls for a further examination of client satisfaction (see Part 5) and client retention strategies (see Part 4).

*Recommended reading:How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting Growth*

#### 8. Role of the Founder(s) or Owner(s) in the Sale

Finally, I closely consider the role of the founders or owners in the sales process. From my experience, many founders and owners in boutique consultancy firms start as doer-seller-type profiles. This involvement is essential in the early years as they are typically the strongest ambassadors for the consultancy's expertise and are crucial for establishing trust with initial clients.However, as the firm grows, this dynamic often needs to evolve. Over time, the firm needs to develop a sales process that is not overly dependent on the founders or owners. This allows founders/owners to transition from working IN the business to working ON the company, a crucial shift for long-term growth and sustainability. This evolution signifies a maturing consultancy preparing for the next phase of the journey.

## The assessment, Part 4: Developing existing clients

Part 4 of my assessment centers around "Developing Existing Clients." A healthy balance of new and existing clients, often favouring the latter in a 70:30 ratio (see Part 3), is a crucial indicator of a consultancy's long-term sustainability.Achieving this balance hinges significantly on the firm's expertise in service offering design, aiming to foster long-term relationships rather than transient project-based engagements. Many consultancies hit a 'project wall' – continually cycling through short-term projects and inevitably losing clients after each engagement.This pattern burdens the firm enormously, necessitating a constant influx of new clients and the associated challenges of acquisition, onboarding, and delivery. This is why the capacity to design services that extend beyond initial projects is critical. It promotes client retention and enhances the long-term health and viability of the consultancy.In this part of the assessment, I delve into the firm's ability to cultivate enduring client relationships through effective service design (beyond the initial client project).

*Recommended reading:Why Do So Many Consultancies Neglect Former and Existing Clients? That’s Where the Money Is!*

### The main KPIs of Part 4

#### 1. Type of Clients

In my assessment, I first examine the types of clients the consultancy works with. This provides insights into the potential for developing long-term relationships.

Some client types naturally lend themselves to ongoing engagements, while others may be more project-focused. Based on my experience, understanding and managing the client mix can be pivotal in strategizing for client development and retention.

#### 2. Client Concentration

I then look at client concentration, essentially how reliant the consultancy is on a few big clients.

I've often seen that over-reliance on a few clients can pose significant risks. If one of these major clients were to leave, it could have a detrimental impact on the consultancy's revenue and stability.

Balancing the client portfolio is crucial for risk mitigation and ensuring the consultancy's resilience.

#### 3. Existing Client Tenure

I also assess the tenure of existing clients. This helps me understand how long clients typically stay engaged with the consultancy.

Longer tenures often indicate strong client satisfaction and effective service delivery. However, if the average tenure is short, it could suggest potential issues in client retention that need addressing.

But wait...there might be a few risks to balance when clients remain too long and become too powerful in the relationship. See the recommended reading below.

Recommended post:Do your existing consulting clients hold too much power in the relationship?

#### 4. Service Offering Design Capacity Score

Lastly, I evaluate the consultancy's service offering design capacity. This score reflects how well the firm can design enduring client relationships by providing more profound services and expertise.

A high score suggests the consultancy is adept at creating value-added services that extend beyond initial projects, fostering long-term partnerships.

In my experience, a consultancy's ability to continuously innovate and deliver relevant, high-value services is a crucial driver of client loyalty and business sustainability.

As I always say: 'Service Offering Design is an expertise on its own'.

## The assessment, Part 5: Structural Strength and Existential Health

This final assessment segment encapsulates several fundamental aspects, such as client satisfaction, infrastructure, utilization, cash flow management, and retention of key players. Though these components may seem diverse, they all contribute to the conscious design of a robust, future-ready consultancy.I've found that moving away from an 'ad hoc' approach to a deliberately designed operational strategy is pivotal in laying solid foundations for growth and stability. This conscious design of the consultancy practice allows the founders and owners to shift from reactive to proactive management, crucially enhancing the consultancy's ability to navigate future challenges and opportunities.This section evaluates how effectively the consultancy has established these solid foundations and its readiness to grow and evolve.

Recommended post:Dear consultancy owner, is your consultancy designed to succeed?

### The main KPIs of Part 5

#### 1. Client Satisfaction

When evaluating client satisfaction, consultancies often resort to quick, digital measures like NPS scores.

While they provide a snapshot (and I do review them), I don't like them as the single source of client feedback. An NPS score can't capture the depth and complexity of a client's experience.

In my perspective, a full review should encompass an open dialogue about the client's overall experience, the tangible outcomes of the project, and any areas for improvement. It should delve into aspects like the perceived value of the consultancy's services, the quality of communication, the responsiveness to client needs, and how well the project's objectives were met.

Oh, and by the way, I recommend discussing the client's future needs and how the consultancy can continue to support them. This not only builds a stronger relationship with the client but also offers the consultancy valuable insights to refine its services and strategic approach.

#### 2. Cash Flow Management

Cash flow management is another critical element I evaluate when assessing a consultancy. Sound cash flow management not only signifies financial health but also a robust understanding of the firm's income and expenditure dynamics.

My experience shows that consultancies with well-managed cash flows demonstrate a higher level of resilience in volatile market conditions.Beyond this, it's crucial to recognize the impact of steady cash flow on the decision-making process within a consultancy. When cash flow is well-managed and predictable, it creates an atmosphere of financial stability and peace of mind for the owners.

This, in turn, allows them the comfort and confidence to make strategic choices that uphold the firm's value proposition and integrity. It empowers them to say 'no' to non-ideal clients or projects, preventing overstretching and safeguarding the firm's reputation and focus.

#### 3. Retention of Key Players

Assessing the retention of key players within a consultancy provides me with insights into the organization's work culture, career progression opportunities, and how well it values its talent.

However, the implications of retaining key players extend beyond this. The protection of know-how and specialized expertise is a critical aspect of the consulting industry. High staff turnover can lead to losing essential knowledge and insights, impacting the consultancy's capacity to deliver quality services.Additionally, the know-how transfer process, necessary in case of high team turnover, can be costly and effort-intensive. This involves not just the monetary expenses associated with hiring and training but also the time and resources invested in ensuring the new members gain a sufficient understanding of the consultancy's processes, clients, and specific methodologies.In today's labour market, characterized by significant shortages, hiring and finding the right talent has become an increasingly daunting challenge. Hence, retaining key players has emerged as a more strategic, cost-effective, and operationally sound approach to safeguarding a consultancy's delivery capability.

Team retention is a critical KPI, you bet.

#### 4. Infrastructure 1: CRM

Using a CRM system is a testament to the consultancy's commitment to managing client relationships and prospects effectively. Not only does a CRM system streamline communication and improve service delivery, but it also serves as a vital tool for managing the prospect pipeline.By providing a consolidated view of each client's engagement history, preferences, needs, and potential leads, a CRM can significantly enhance the firm's ability to convert prospects into clients. Its role in tracking interactions with potential clients makes it indispensable for forecasting future business and ensuring a healthy sales pipeline.From my experience, a well-implemented CRM is essential to maintaining a clear vision of the consultancy's growth trajectory.

#### 5. Infrastructure 2: Project Management Tooling

Project management tooling reflects the consultancy's dedication to delivering projects efficiently, on time, and fully transparent with the clients (clients have access to the tool).

These tools can significantly enhance productivity, coordination, and communication among team members, leading to more successful project outcomes and increased client satisfaction. The Excel sheet era is over.

I have supported several consultancy acquisitions due diligences in the past years, and the buyers and investors were always very keen to understand the way projects were managed and how well this was organized from a structural point of view.

#### 6. Infrastructure 3: Consultancy KPI Monitoring

The implementation of consultancy KPI monitoring shows the firm's commitment to continuous performance improvement.

Tracking the correct numbers and KPIs - the ones from this assessment, a bare minimum, I’d say - will provide valuable insights into areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, driving strategic decision-making.

Doing these assessments and being on the receiving side of the numbers and KPIs, it’s often quite surprising how many boutique consultancies struggle with retrieving all these numbers and KPIs.

#### 7. Utilization

Finally, I delve into utilization rates.

Now, anyone who knows me understands that I maintain a restrained appreciation for utilization when it's purely wielded to drive up billable hours. This is a scenario I've encountered all too frequently in my line of work.

I often refer to this as 'the dark side of utilization'. It can engender a counterproductive atmosphere within a consulting team by suggesting that the quantity of hours billed precedes the quality of value delivered and outcomes achieved.

This skewed perspective, I believe, fundamentally misses the point of what consultancy should indeed be about.

To me, the (important, yes!) utilization KPI is about understanding the bigger picture of resource allocation and capacity planning. Proper utilization measurement can uncover bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and potential burnout risks, guiding the strategic direction for balanced growth and sustainability.

## Conclusion

In my experience, executing a thorough evaluation of a consultancy's health and performance across these five key areas can be a revelation. Many founder-led boutique consultancies, absorbed in the daily demands of their business, may need to pay more attention to the importance of a holistic, data-driven view of their operations.By undertaking such an analysis, we delve into the heart of the consultancy, exploring the nuances of the market positioning, the strategic overview, the power in the sale, the existing client development, and finally, the structural strength and existential health. Each part of this assessment is like a puzzle, contributing to the complete picture of the consultancy's current standing and future potential.It's worth noting that it's not a one-off exercise but an ongoing process allowing regular checkpoints and calibration. I've often seen that consultancies that stay on top of these numbers and KPIs are better equipped to navigate the industry's complexities and maintain their growth trajectory. They can adapt more swiftly, identify opportunities more accurately, and mitigate risks more effectively.I strongly recommend investing time and resources in such a comprehensive assessment. It's not about ticking boxes or meeting industry standards; it's about conscious business design, proactive management, and sustainable growth.Consultancy owners should not let the consultancy run them.Data and numbers aren't just figures on a spreadsheet; they tell a consultancy's story and hint at its future chapters. Consultancy owners should listen closely, act consciously, and let these insights guide their path.

# How Consultancies Can Reach the Unconverted Audience in 4 Steps

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 27 June 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-consultancies-can-reach-the-unconverted-audience-in-4-steps

---

This article was last updated on 27 June 2023

“Luk, how are we supposed to convince those who are not actively looking to buy consulting services within our target audience to not just buy such services but do so from us?” This is a question that was posed to me during one of the training sessions I hosted earlier this year.

Indeed. How do consultancies increase their odds and activate those “not in the market”?Are sales teams supposed to send bulk emails with sales brochures and wait until a couple of contacts bite? Are consultants supposed to call every contact they have and try to convince them to allocate a budget towards their consulting services?No, of course not. Who has the time, the man power, or the patience for such low-ROI efforts!The answer lies in educating the market and activating prospects through a gradual, 4-step thought leadership journey. I’ll elaborate on the steps in this post.

## Step 1: Inspiring the audience throughawarenesscontent

At this initial stage, consultancies should maximize the level of market awareness of their expertise.In practice, this means producing thought leadership content that gets the target audience’s attention.The goal of the awareness-stage thought leadership: Why should the target audience care about what the consultancy has to say.How this is achieved: Articles, webinars, speaking engagements, LinkedIn posts, and other content formats at this stage should demonstrate the transformational potential of certain actions.Content examples:

• “Why consultancies will grow faster with compelling thought leadership”.

• “Why blockchain technology is essential to your supply chain operations.”

• “Why ChatGPT will rewrite the rules of search engine optimization (SEO).”

• “Why online retailers must embrace contextual commerce.”

• "How can adopting sustainable practices increase profit margins for manufacturers?"

• "What benefits can small businesses reap by embarking on a digital transformation journey?"

• "Why should consultancies prioritize the well-being of their employees to enhance productivity?"

Engaging the target audience is not easy. There are tons of pieces online. However, not everyone who produces content on a semi-regular basis can be called a “thought leader” or a subject matter “authority”. Far from it.Truly valuable content helps the target audience look at their status quo from a different perspective. It doesn’t just list pain points. It places them in a larger context, showing why inaction will most certainly have detrimental results.Buyers expect deep levels of expertise from consultancies. The way to demonstrate such expertise is not through a nicely designed brochure that provides a laundry list of services with a couple of generic testimonials sprinkled throughout.It’s to let the target audience make up their own mind and come to the conclusion that the consultancy is indeed knowledgeable by generously sharing that knowledge.Recommended reading:The Single Biggest Mistake Consultancies Make: Talking About Themselves

## Step 2: Educating the audience throughdemandcontent

Alright. Let’s say a consultancy acquired some regular readers through its inspirational content in Step 1. There is some initial level of trust from the audience. They find the content engaging and interesting enough to allocate time on a regular basis to read/listen to it. Now what?It’s time to back up the transformational potential of content pieces with practical suggestions.The goal of the demand-stage thought leadership: How can the target audience solve their problems.How this is achieved: Thought leadership pieces at this stage should offer problem-resolution advice.

Content example:

• “5 ways to create compelling thought leadership to grow a consultancy”.

• “3 ways to increase transparency in your supply chain using blockchain technology.”

• “7 ways ChatGPT will change the way users interact with search engines.”

• “These are the conversion rates to strive for with contextual commerce.”

• "How can a strategic approach toward sustainability improve your manufacturing operations?"

• "What is the step-by-step guide to successfully implementing a digital transformation in your small business?"

• "How can a well-being program improve your consultancy's performance and client satisfaction?"

Once potential buyers of consulting services are made aware of the transformational potential of taking certain actions, it’s time to equip them with a few tools and resources to actually initialize change.“But Luk, why are we giving away the secrets? Why would they even need us afterwards!” The ever-present fear of making yourself redundant by being generous with your knowledge. Honestly, I have yet to come across a case where this strategy backfired.I regularly share the “secrets of my trade”. I explain exactly which tools I use and how I use them. For example, in thepost on content hacks, I share where I draw my inspiration for all my content work. These are things that every single consultancy can adopt in their own operations. Inthis post on the content machine, I explain which software I use, how I promote my pieces, how I recycle and repurpose them – step-by-step.And guess what? This type of content has yet to discourage my target audience from reaching out to me.It’s the opposite, in fact. These pieces, together with all the other content that I put out, allow me to develop and grow trust with my audience. They facilitate discussions. I’ve received countless emails and calls over the last few years from individual consultants and practice leaders wanting my opinion on how to adapt these strategies to their unique needs. I’ve received questions asking for further advice. I’ve received requests to help implement strategies.By encouraging the target audience to get proactive about solving their pain points and offering a set of tools to do so consultancies achieve a massive win – they spark the need for action in their target audience. Any marketer and sales executive will attest to just how valuable this moment is!

## Step 3: Motivating the audience throughconversioncontent

Alright, so the audience is now mature enough to know that there is a problem and have a few ideas on how they can go about addressing them. Now is the time to solidify the need to address it in their minds.You see, high-performance consultancies do not address just any problem. Their area of specialization is not picked at random. They are paid premium fees not to address any pain point.They are successful because they identified a need that’s extremely high-return for their clients and they aligned their expertise with delivering that return at the highest level.Oftentimes, it’s deep-seeded problems that are not visible on the surface. However, these furiously successful firms have the depth of expertise required to spot the symptoms. They educate their audience on why these symptoms speak to a more serious issue and guide them through the journey of discovering for themselves why failing to address these issues will have costly results.The goal of the demand-stage thought leadership: Why should the target audience buy the consulting services?How this is achieved: Thought leadership pieces at this stage show the risk/cost of inaction. They make a strong business case for investing.Content example:

• “Without thought leadership, prospective executives turn to competition in 73% of the cases”.

• “60% of executives expect this supply chain function to be fully blockchain-operated within 5 years.”

• “These SEO strategies help news publishers foolproof their content strategy against the risks of ChatGPT.”

• “How this small ecommerce store increased its sales by 400% in 1 year using contextual commerce.”

• "Did you know manufacturers not investing in sustainability face a 60% higher risk of regulatory penalties?"

• "Are you aware that small businesses ignoring digital transformation risk losing 50% of their market share to competitors?"

• "Did you know that consultancies that do not prioritize employee well-being see a 30% higher turnover rate?"

The thought leadership example above? It’s an actual statistic from one of the best studies on the subject that I included inone of my pieces.I urge consultancies in my pieces to change their way of thinking about marketing and business development and to start making changes now.Having worked with a long list of firms, spoken to hundreds of consulting leaders, audited dozens of consultancies and consulting practices, I have acquired the experience and the knowledge to confidently state that the cost of inaction in terms of switching to an audience-education-based marketing strategy is the eventual demise of a business. It may not be today or tomorrow. But it will happen.First it will become more difficult to get new clients. Then the pressure on each consultant and marketing executive to chase contacts will build up. Then the firm will start offering discounts and making all sorts of crazy accommodations to sign up a new client or retain an old one. This spiral continues until absolutely no one in the market has any idea what the firm is actually about and the business comes to a painful end.This is not a made-up story I try to tell to scare my prospects into purchasing my services. It’s the reality that I actively try to help consultancies avoid.It’s the consultancies’ job to spot problems before there is no turning back and help their clients adjust the course, coming out on the other end more successful, more efficient, or more profitable.Recommended reading:Without Thought Leadership, Consultancies Will Fail

## Step 4: Activating the audience throughonboardingcontent

Alright, this is the ultimate step – signing up prospects.By now, they are not only aware of the problem but are eager to address it. However, going all in all at once can be scary. Decision makers might be hesitant to start big. They want to first dip their toes in the water to see if it is indeed worth it.Consultancies should make this step as easy as possible for their target audience. It’s about giving them the taste of the full potential.The goal of the demand-stage thought leadership: How can the target audience get started.How this is achieved: Thought leadership pieces should make it easy to get started and help reduce the fear of failure.Content example:

• “Take our thought leadership maturity assessment to benchmark your current status”.

• “See how your supply chain tech stack compares to the Top 10 companies in the industry with this 3-day audit.”

• “Audit your links to see how many of your top performing pages risk significant drops in organic traffic over the next 3 months.”

• “Enter the keywords for your products to discover 20+ contextual commerce opportunities.”

• "Ready to embrace sustainability? Start with our free consultation to evaluate your manufacturing firm's current practices."

• "Want to drive digital transformation? Avail of our free introductory session to identify your small business's digital needs."

• "Looking to enhance your consultancy's performance? Use our free employee well-being assessment to identify areas for improvement."

This is the discovery stage of working with a prospect who is a soon-to-be client. Once a consultancy convinces prospects that there is a problem and it does require action, they should help these prospects understand the depth of the issue in their own organization.Change is difficult. Uncertainty is scary. Business leaders and buyers are more wary about allocating budgets towards unplanned items – be it software or service purchases – than ever. Between the pandemic and the recession, the buyers need some sort of assurances.That’s why it’s crucial that consultancies find a way to introduce prospects to the complete image of what the transformation will look like by first giving an easy way to take a glance.This is also yet another brick in the foundation of building trust with the target audience. Instead of hitting them with the big sell, consultancies demonstrate that buyers can take a step back and turn around if they want. And many will. After all, no marketing strategy delivers a 100% conversion rate.However, many will remain. Many will go through this journey and discover that they indeed have fundamental problems that need addressing. Because this particular consultancy helped them go through this journey, they will have trust in that firm and would want it to take their pain-ridden state and transform it into the “promised land”.

## How the execution of the strategy looks in practice

Of course, the stages are not as synchronized as I outlined them in this post. Some prospects enter the journey at a more advanced stage. Firms also can’t set up systems where they split the stages and cover one for three months, another one for three months, and so on.Rather, these are the types of thought leadership pieces and journeys that consulting firms should aspire to. For example, those who subscribe to the newsletter from a webinar page that presented content aligned with Step 1 goals should receive pieces related to that subject from Steps 2 and 3.The steps are not always completed in this perfect manner. That’s why it’s so important that consultancies strive to develop a loyal audience by producing value-adding authentic content that, first and foremost, educates this audience. The more loyal readers/listeners/followers a firm has, the better it can control the journey.It’s about nurturing trust and engagement. And that’s only possible when the efforts are consistent and the pieces that a consultancy produces address pain points of the target audience head-on.

## In conclusion

I always say that not all content is thought leadership and not all thought leadership delivers equal results. That’s why I wanted to write this article – to show that thought leadership requires a deliberate strategy. It’s not about writing whatever comes to mind, but thinking through what the goal is and identifying steps to get there.Firms can’t just always scream “You have a problem, you have a problem!” They need to guide their audience through the process of discovering it for themselves and showing them ways to start taking actions.

# The Negative Impact of Obsessive Revenue Focus in Consulting

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 23 May 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-negative-impact-of-obsessive-revenue-focus-in-consulting

---

Revenue, revenue, revenue.Every business review or workshop I conduct starts with an ideation board of some kind – it helps me understand the priorities, struggles, and goals of the consulting firm I’m working with.And 90% of the time, the ideation board is covered with “revenue” written on sticky notes – “revenue growth”, “20% revenue increase”, “new revenue channels”, etc.Every decision – no matter how small – is made through the revenue mindset in these firms. And I won’t sit on my high horse and claim that revenue is not essential. Of course, it is. Consulting is a business.However, I believe that the single-minded obsession with revenue is unhealthy. It can be detrimental to the long-term success of a consultancy.This is what I’d like to discuss in this article.

## How the obsession with revenue can undermine other aspects of a consulting business

Revenue has always been my #1 focus. I had aggressive growth targets, especially after my boutique consultancy got acquired by Deloitte.And that’s fine. I love the consulting frontline. Business development and new opportunities are essential, consultancy owners can’t just sit there and wait. Nothing will happen.However, step-by-step, in working with and talking to many consulting firms in the past years, I also learned the downsides of an extreme revenue focus.

• It stimulates unhealthy short-term thinking. Consulting leaders are less motivated to invest in resources, staff needs, and other assets without immediate ROI. Consultants, too, feel pressured to deliver on short-term revenue goals, sacrificing long-term opportunities. For example, it can be rushing to finish a project to ensure the client is invoiced and paid this quarter.

• It causes greedy sales behaviors. The extreme focus on revenue makes consulting leaders and owners push harder to sell, which risks undermining the foundation of consulting client relationships – trust.

• It leads to accepting work outside of the narrow focus. This, in turn, dilutes the consultancy's reputation in the market. The firm also can’t charge the same fees or provide the same level of value as it usually does within the narrow expertise area.

• It suppresses the development of educational content. Every minute of every day is dedicated to trying to close new clients and complete projects for existing clients. If something doesn’t bring almost immediate revenue results, it’s not considered worth investing time in.

• It causes a toxic incentive mindset. A short-term revenue obsession is often fueled by incentivizing consultants and consulting leaders with hefty commissions for closing new clients. Those who are not natural salespeople end up feeling resentful. More sales-driven people often start employing aggressive sales tactics to get that commission. The culture within the consultancy gradually deteriorates.

• It dilutes a strong positioning in the market. All of the negative consequences I’ve already listed result in the consultancy losing itself – it's positioning, the value it delivers to clients, the social proof the firm generates from focusing on a particular type of work, and so on. The erosion of positioning leads to the devaluation of market reputation – something that can take a long time to repair.

• It beams the consultancy into commodity projects in the pricing rat race. Offering more services, offering discounts, and catering to every client request no matter how outside of the initially agreed-upon project parameters the request is.

• It’s just terribly tiring. Every tiny dip in the revenue graph becomes a point of frustration. Every campaign that doesn’t yield projected ROIs makes consulting leaders and consultancy owners anxious. It’s an exhausting way to run a consulting business!

> The road to become a high-performing consultancy is a constant upward climb, with new roadblocks arising and new processes to embrace. Consultancy owners must always be striving to improve and never allow themselves to become complacent, as the ultimate goal is TO FIND JOY IN THE PROCESS. Failure to find joy in the process will impede progress and hinder the ability to achieve the desired outcomes.

The road to become a high-performing consultancy is a constant upward climb, with new roadblocks arising and new processes to embrace. Consultancy owners must always be striving to improve and never allow themselves to become complacent, as the ultimate goal is TO FIND JOY IN THE PROCESS. Failure to find joy in the process will impede progress and hinder the ability to achieve the desired outcomes.

## What I learned from a recent due diligence

In one of my articles –4 Lessons Learned From A Consultancy Due Diligence– I share the four additional dimensions that an investment firm wanted to get a clear assessment of when considering purchasing a consultancy.I strongly suggest reading the article in full. Here, I’ll summarize these ‘investor dimensions’:

• A unique ‘reputation check’ (that’s why they reached out to me in the first place)

• The co-owners’ alignment on the growth strategy of the consultancy

• The consultancy’s business infrastructure

• The firm’s performance against consulting-specific KPIs

I want to highlight the first two dimensions. In my experience, high-performance consultancies pay just as much attention to growing their reputational footprint and building internal alignment on the growth strategy as they do on revenue.

### Dimension #1: Growing the reputational footprint through target audience education

I avidly believe in freely and generously sharing knowledge as a consultancy leader/owner. That’s hardly news to any of my regular readers.However – and I can’t emphasize that enough – audience education is not just a feel-good activity. It’s a proven business development and growth strategy in consulting.Recommended reading:Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting BusinessAudience education is the foundation of building a reputational footprint as a consultancy. It establishes TRUST between the target audience and the consultancy.Consulting leaders and consultancy owners should dedicate time every week to enriching the knowledge hub of their firms – creating authoritative content that addresses the most pressing pain points of the narrowly defined target audience.Content of high educational value gets shared and re-shared within networks, growing the firm's visibility.That’s what high-performance consultancies do. Instead of selling their services, they showcase their expertise instead. They build trust at scale with their audience and then convert that to new consultancy opportunities.

*Recommended reading:Without Thought Leadership, Consultancies Will FailWhile this strategy will not deliver results overnight – it takes time to build up the library of thought leadership content and put systems in place to track and measure the results – once it starts delivering results, it never stops.*

The market reputation of consultancy owners/leaders is a critical factor that significantly impacts the success and growth of their consulting firm.A strong reputation in the market can establish the leaders as credible experts in their field, differentiate their firm from competitors, build brand recognition, attract potential clients seeking their expertise, and attract top talent in recruitment efforts.

### Dimension #2: Ensuring internal alignment with the growth strategy of the consultancy amongst the owners

The single-minded obsession with revenue leads to short-term strategies: how to close this lead within the next two weeks, how to wrap up the project within this quarter, etc. It leaves little room for long-term planning.Long-term growth planning is essential to long-term success. A consultancy should have a clear idea of where it wants to get and create a roadmap to get there.

And for any growth strategy to succeed, it needs internal alignment. Every person within a consultancy – from top leadership to entry-level consultants and marketers – should clearly understand the long-term goal and the roadmap to achieving it. It’s up to consultancy owners and consulting leaders to get the buy-in from every team member.When a cart is pulled in different directions, it doesn’t go far. When 1-2 people only pull it, progress is slow. However, when an entire team comes together and pulls it forward, things speed up much faster.Internal alignment can’t be achieved when the focus is solely on revenue. Again, it goes back to making decisions for the short-term benefit of the firm as opposed to building up the foundation and creating campaigns that contribute to the long-term goals.

## What I learned from my consultancy business reviews

One of my biggest takeaways from the business reviews I’ve conducted for struggling firms and high-performance consultancies is that revenue growth should be built upon a mix of short-term goals and a long-term vision.As part of this rounded approach to revenue growth, I recommend that consultancies take a close look at how they go about the following two processes:

• Clearly defining expertise (with the target audience) and service offering. This will serve two purposes: (1) It will help focus resources on a smaller audience pool instead of scattering them across too broad an audience, leading to disappointing ROIs. (2) It will provide consultancy owners and leaders with clear parameters for the type of work/clients to take one or pitch to. Anything outside of these parameters becomes an automatic ‘No’.

• Establishing a balance between retaining or expanding work with existing clients and recruiting new ones. I refer to these processes as ‘farming’ and ‘hunting’ and discuss the benefits and downsides of both inmy article on how to find the balance. The most successful firms I’ve enjoyed working with and observing derive most of their revenue from existing clients (70%). Client acquisition is used to grow the pipeline of work and keep the pipeline healthy (30%). This balance between existing and new clients eliminates the stress of ensuring short-term revenue, gives consultancies room to be strategic to target new clients, and sets a firm up for continuous, reliable growth. And I’m not talking only about revenue growth. I’m also referring to increasing profit margins.

> There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance, between learning-driven and ego-driven decisiveness, and between being a focused consulting leader and a know-it-all. One contributes to success in consulting. The other one slowly but surely undermines and weakens a consulting business.

There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance, between learning-driven and ego-driven decisiveness, and between being a focused consulting leader and a know-it-all. One contributes to success in consulting. The other one slowly but surely undermines and weakens a consulting business.

## In conclusion

Revenue is essential and foundational for the long-term health of a consultancy.Consulting leaders and owners should pay close attention to it, use all revenue-related data to adjust tactics and strategies, set new goals, etc.However, consulting firms must balance generating revenue and delivering high-quality work while taking care of the team, building long-term relationships with clients, and becoming a master at educating the target audience.These would be the four dimensions I would focus on (instead of a single-minded revenue growth focus):

• Consultancy owner alignment on the growth strategy

• Audience education

• Expertise and service offering clarity

• A healthy balance between developing existing clients and acquiring new clients

Short-term revenue growth does not always indicate that a consultancy is on the path to long-term success. That’s why consultancy owners should be mindful of the risk of developing tunnel vision and try to avoid it by building a revenue growth strategy based on foundational elements that will sustain long-term growth.Experts don’t sell. They get invited. Revenue follows.

# How a Consultancy Can Get Crushed by the Ego of Its Owners

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 01 May 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-a-consultancy-can-get-crushed-by-the-ego-of-its-owners

---

“Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety. We can’t keep learning if we think we already know everything…we have to build an organization and a system around what we do – one that is about the work and not about us.”These wise words are from a book I devoured – “Ego Is The Enemy” by Ryan Holiday.Indeed, ego is the enemy. I’ve observed it countless times in my work with consulting leaders and – I have to admit – I had experienced it personally.And that’s what I’d like to discuss in this article.There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance, between learning-driven and ego-driven decisiveness, between being a focused consulting leader and a know-it-all.One contributes to success in consulting. The other one slowly but surely undermines and weakens a consulting business.

## The benefits and risks of ego in consulting

I’d like to clarify something off the bat.A healthy amount of ego is good. In fact, it is often the prerequisite to building and growing successful consultancies, especially in the hypercompetitive consulting world.One has to go into the consulting business with a certain level of confidence – both in own abilities and in the consulting offering.Confidence is also an important quality of a leader. When managing a team or an entire consultancy, leaders need to project a healthy amount of confidence, reliability, trustworthiness.It’s difficult to inspire others and help them achieve their full potential when a leader second-guesses every tiny decision.However, confidence should never cross into the territory of arrogance. That’s a dangerous territory where a leader starts treating own assumptions as facts.

> “People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes”. (Mark Manson in his book ‘The subtle art of not giving a f*ck’)

“People who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes”. (Mark Manson in his book ‘The subtle art of not giving a f*ck’)

*Recommended reading:Why Are Consultancies Appointing New Partners Without a Voice?*

### Making assumptions but failing to test them

I’ve witnessed this in every business and aspect of life: an unchecked ego leads to making assumptions yet failing to test them.It can be an inconsequential thing in everyday life – sticking to the same brand of food because “it’s the best” and refusing to try alternatives.In running a consulting firm, unfortunately, such refusal to test assumptions can lead to more dire consequences: a failed service launch, misallocation of resources, inefficient processes, overworked staff, unhappy clients, and, ultimately, the failure of the entire business.

> “It sure sometimes feels like consulting is the industry most resistant to advice”. (Florian Heinrichs, former Accenture marketer, now consulting marketing advisor).

“It sure sometimes feels like consulting is the industry most resistant to advice”. (Florian Heinrichs, former Accenture marketer, now consulting marketing advisor).

Of course, those with a fair amount of experience tend to base their assumptions on more than just a gut feeling. But that doesn’t negate the need to constantly challenge and test assumptions.Why? Because knowledge can get outdated in the blink of an eye. What prospects need, how they purchase consulting services, what they expect from their outside partners – there are a ton of variables that can change the consulting ecosystem.And sticking to old assumptions because they were proven right 5-10 years ago is simply short-sighted.

## The downward spiral of big egos in consulting

The consulting world is rampant with big egos. I know. That used to be me.In my early consulting years I used to call the office with the message: you won’t believe what I just sold.The answer of the team: “damn, did you do that again?” I was proud to sell projects we had never done before. My ego wanted to crush every new opportunity that came my way.My ego caused me to overestimate my expertise and underestimate the impact ‘selling-without-experience’ had on the team.Here are just a few examples of ego-driven behavior I’ve observed in consulting leaders over the years:

• Saying yes: They say yes to every prospect because they feel the need to crush every new opportunity. Their ego does not allow them to differentiate between distraction and depth/focus.

• Blaming: They blame everyone else for failure. Not enough leads generated? Marketers suck. The pipeline of projects looks weak? It’s the senior consultants’ fault. A client is unhappy? It’s the project leader who messed up. Undoubtedly, there are instances when it is, indeed, the case. However, consulting leaders with big egos tend to perceive every failure as someone’s fault instead of examining their own role in it.

• Positioning erosion: They never revise the positioning of their consultancy or put it to a test. As mentioned earlier, things change. Whether it’s the pandemic, the recession, technological advancements, or a bunch of small things – what prospects need is constantly evolving. Egotistical consulting leaders refuse to accept this change and struggle to re-assess the alignment of their business with the current needs of prospects.

• Toxicity: They create a toxic, demotivating environment internally. Big egos from consulting leaders tend to discourage opposing views and productive debate. And when employees don’t feel heard – whether we’re talking about consultants, marketing/sales/business development, or admin staff – they no longer feel invested in the success of the firm.

• Service dilution: They constantly expand the service portfolio. Instead of deepening the expertise of the consultancy, ego-driven consulting leaders feel the need to grab as many opportunities as possible by adding more and more (shiny) new services to please as many prospects as possible. This dilutes the expertise of the firm, makes its positioning on the market unclear at best, and most likely erodes the consultancy’s profitability.

> “...ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It’s a magnet for enemies and errors.” (Ryan Holiday)

## How high-performing consultancies keep their egos in check

While I’m often brought on board to help consulting firms that are struggling, I’ve also had the pleasure of working with already incredibly successful, high-performing consultancies.

And one thing that consulting leaders share across these firms is they know how to keep their egos in check.They are confident in their abilities yet do not pretend to have all the answers. They constantly re-examine their own assumptions and are not afraid to take a long, hard look at internal processes and own behavior. They are hungry for knowledge. They take pride in their expertise yet remain humble, share their knowledge generously, and often turn into leading voices in the market.They are able to find that balance between being decisive, highly competent leaders and good listeners of the voices from within and outside of their consultancy.

Here are some of the strategies that high-performing consultancies utilize to make sure their decision-making is not ego-driven:

• They look at numbers to understand the well-being of their consulting business. More specifically, they constantly monitor profitability and margins. They understand that revenue growth alone can tell a misleading story. Their goal is to create maximum value for their clients, constantly deepen the expertise of the firm, and drive growth through efficiencies – a direct result of repetition in work (big ego’s tend to dislike repetition).

• They talk to their target audience to make sure their knowledge of the industry and perception of their own consulting services remain relevant. The past clients of a high-performing consultancy can explain in 30 seconds what the firm can achieve and why what it does is of value. Such firms’ case studies cover both the process and highlight the measurable results achieved for clients. They constantly question and refine their positioning and make sure it’s aligned with the market needs by staying in touch with past clients, sharing educational, pain-resolution-driven, authoritative content, and measuring its results.

• They foster a culture internally where team members are not afraid to admit to be wrongbecause their leaders constantly challenge their own assumptions. This facilitates healthy discussions and improves internal alignment. Marketing tends to work perfectly in sync with the consulting side. Business development is driven by the reputational footprint that the firm has established as the market leader in a narrow field.

• They have external advisors/mentorswhose advice they actually take to heart - someone who can provide a feedback loop. In some instances, it’s an informal network of advisors. In other instances, it’s hiring an outside expert to audit the business strategy and positioning of the firm. This is how I got a chance to work with numerous studious consultancies.

• They learn how and when to admit defeat. They understand that not every initiative will succeed. They know when to pull the plug on a campaign to avoid burning more resources. They look at data and derive insights. They learn and grow as a result of these defeats, instead of letting their egos pursue pointless opportunities.

## In conclusion

Ego can very easily become a liability for consulting firms.

When gone unchecked, it creates tunnel vision and a ton of missed opportunities. And I’m not referring to the opportunities of working with more clients. It’s about missed opportunities to work with the right clients, opportunities to deepen the expertise, therefore delivering stronger value and charging higher fees.It’s about opportunities to create a sustainable consulting business where employees have a sense of achievement, and opportunities to build the reputation in the market as the expert.

> “Why is success so ephemeral? Ego shortens it. Whether a collapse is dramatic or a slow erosion, it’s always possible and often unnecessary. We stop learning, we stop listening, and we lose our grasp on what matters. We become victims of ourselves and the competition. Sobriety, open-mindedness, organization, and purpose – these are the great stabilizers. They balance out the ego and pride that comes with achievement and recognition.” (Ryan Holiday)

# (Case Study) How This Consultancy Cut Back 30% of Its Services Yet Improved Profitability

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 25 April 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/how-this-consultancy-cut-back-30-percent-of-its-services-yet-improved-profitability

---

Last year, I worked with a boutique HR consultancy. The consultancy approached me to help them reposition in their market.One of the three partners retired the year before. The two remaining partners had to reassess the business's state and decide whether to keep the retired partner's services and his team of consultants in the service portfolio or phase them out.They made the difficult decision to remove the retired partner’s services from the portfolio gradually. My job was to conduct a business review and help the consultancy sharpen its new market positioning.It’s a fascinating case study where a firm actively chose to reduce its service portfolio yet came out on top in terms of profits.Since I see so many consultancies going in the opposite direction – adding more services to maintain growth – I thought it would be essential to share the story of this particular high-performing consultancy that did the opposite: reducing services.

## A bit of history

The two partners founded the consultancy in 2006. Due to their similar experience backgrounds, their narrow positioning was in rewards, compensation, and benefits.In 2012, they brought on board a third partner, an ex-CHRO. Due to his experience and network connections, he was brought into the consultancy to develop HR services as part of the service portfolio. These included HR strategy, organisational design, performance management, and employee training and development.By 2021, the consultancy’s size and revenue could be summarised with the following numbers:

• 38 consultants in total – 28 in rewards and compensations, 10 in HR

• Revenue was just under €6M.

• The rewards and compensation team generated 70% of the revenue, and the HR team 30%.

• The gross margin was 34%.

• The net profit was 14%.

In 2021, the third partner retired. Partners 1 and 2 no longer had someone leading the HR services for the consultancy.

So before promoting someone internally to take over this section of the consultancy, which, for many consulting firms, would’ve been the natural step to ensure continuity, the two partners decided to analyse the consultancy’s performance with and without the HR service offerings.The consultancy’s revenue has been on an upward trajectory for the past 15 years. However, once HR services were added to the mix, despite the revenue growth, the gross margin and net profit declined.Faced with the harsh reality of the numbers, the two partners decided to phase out the HR services from the consultancy’s portfolio by declining any incoming requests and simply wrapping up ongoing/legacy projects over the next 18 months.

## Updating the consultancy’s positioning

Once the decision was made, the two partners contacted me. They wanted my help with assessing their business and crystallising their new positioning.

I loved working on this project. So often, in my work, I am brought on board because a consultancy’s growth has stalled, and I am the one who has to tell them that it’s due to the unfocused nature of their services.In this case, on the other hand, the consulting leaders had already decided to narrow down their focus. They already did the math and, most importantly, believed the math.When faced with similar numbers, I’ve met plenty of consultancy owners who would’ve still refused to cut 30% of their service offerings!Together with the two partners, we went back to the drawing board. We looked at projects with 1) the highest gross margins and 2) the ideal client profile, looking for common elements until we narrowed it down to exactly what type of work was completed and for which type of clients yielded the highest returns.We collected case studies from over the years and testimonials from past clients, looking for pain points that required the most expertise and depth.Finally, we spoke with existing clients to understand why they chose this consultancy over others, which messaging resonated most.Armed with this information, we created a new market positioning for the firm. Upon my advice, the two partners took it for a test drive and ran it past various past and current clients as well as a few prospects.

It worked.The new positioning significantly narrowed the scope of the services offered. It refocused on the original expertise foundation of rewards, benefits, and compensation, the field that delivers the highest gross margins and is closest to the original ideal client profile.

## Old vs. new positioning

So why was the HR part of the service portfolio posting significantly lower returns?

There are several reasons:

• It had a generic positioning in the marketplace. There was nothing to differentiate the services offered under the HR umbrella from hundreds of other HR consultancies of all sizes.

• All work completed in this field was project-based. To keep the business going, the HR consulting team consistently pursued projects and tried to win them with no real differentiator. It comes as no surprise that the win rate was relatively low, given the deadly competition in the HR consultancy space.

• Because winning every new project was so much work, the overall client acquisition cost was high.

• This all led to an unreliable pipeline. It was close to impossible to accurately forecast the pipeline of work and revenue on this side of the business, making resource allocation all the more difficult.

• Finally, to compete, the consulting leader who headed this part of the business consistently offered discounts, which contributed to the poor margins and profitability.

Their reward business, on the other hand, held significant growth potential. Here are just some of the indicators:

• It allowed the firm to transition back to specialist (narrow) positioning and capitalise on its strong reputation.

• A retainer business model delivered a large chunk of revenue. This made it significantly easier to forecast revenue, which, in turn, translated into revenue stability, staffing predictability, and a less stressful business context.

• Due to the firm's strong reputation in rewards, prospects were reaching out to the consultancy – new business was predominantly inbound and organic and existing clients stayed with them for multiple years. As a result, the cost of acquisition was negligible.

• The deep level of expertise in the field enabled the consultants to deliver high-value outcomes for clients, which in turn allowed them to charge premium fees, resulting in strong gross margins and profits.

In summary, the rewards business had been subsidising the HR business for years, and it was time to end this practice.

> "Achieving a laser-sharp, differentiating proposition as a consultancy isn’t easy to achieve and it can feel really scary.Because, in the consultant’s mind, it seems ‘safer’ to be just like everyone else. Let me challenge you with this logic: if your consultancy resembles all other consultancies, it is more likely to fail. If you really want the ‘safest’ option, just go get a job."

Let me challenge you with this logic: if your consultancy resembles all other consultancies, it is more likely to fail. If you really want the ‘safest’ option, just go get a job."

## The outcome of eliminating 30% of the services

As explained earlier, the two partners decided to phase out HR services by completing only ongoing and legacy projects and not taking on any new clients in this field.

Within 18 months, they managed to eliminate this function almost entirely.This, in turn, opened up resources to allocate towards the consultancy's rewards, compensation, and benefits practice. They added a subscription-based product offering and salary benchmarking to clients.Due to this internal restructuring and shifting gears, the consulting firm’s revenue decreased by €850K in 2022.“Oh no! That’s a 14% revenue drop, how terrible!” some may think.That is until we get to the numbers that show the real picture:

• Gross margin end of 2022: 43%.that’s a€200K increase(€2M in 2021 → €2.2M in 2022)this is a 10% improvementthe ‘23 target is to get it >50%

• Net profit end of 2022: 19%that’s a€138K increase (€840K in 2021 → €978K in 2022)this is a 16% improvementthe ‘23 target is to land around 25%

• that’s a€200K increase(€2M in 2021 → €2.2M in 2022)

• this is a 10% improvement

• the ‘23 target is to get it >50%

• that’s a€138K increase (€840K in 2021 → €978K in 2022)

• this is a 16% improvement

• the ‘23 target is to land around 25%

Despite substantial revenue loss, margin and profit improved considerably in 2022!

This is the truth about high-performing consultancies. It’s not about the number of clients or the number of services they boast. It’s about the ability to charge premium fees while significantly reducing costs.And for consultancies with a narrow focus, costs will inevitably decline over time.Repetition allows for the creation of efficient systems, processes, and automation. Project completion time is reduced. The depth of expertise grows, and so does the value to clients. New hires are trained more efficiently. Client acquisition costs decrease as more work is delivered by returning clients and referrals. It’s a glorious loop to heaven!

> "What consultancies need is the confidence that "the void" that is created by saying no, becomes an opportunity to do things that bring them further and closer to what they want to do. And with that comes the confidence that something else will come along, because they're worth it". (David Ducheyne, founder of Otolith Consulting)

And with that comes the confidence that something else will come along, because they're worth it". (David Ducheyne, founder of Otolith Consulting)

## In conclusion

As consultancies strive to grow, most are tempted to add new services to their offerings. I get that.However, service expansion can quickly dilute expertise, increase costs, and reduce margins and profits. I’ve seen this repeatedly.That’s what happened to my client, too. While the addition of new HR services in 2012 attracted new clients and revenue, the consultancy learned it could not charge premium rates for those services and had to continually chase (not 'attract') new business.Luckily, they were able to return to their foundational expertise and reposition the firm, solidifying its trajectory toward becoming a high-performing consultancy.I have no reason to doubt that they will achieve the margins and profits they target in the coming years!

Let me close with an early 2024 quote from the co-owner of this consultancy:

“At first, reducing our services felt like taking a big risk, especially with a 14% cut in revenue. But our re-commitment to what we truly excel at, was unwavering. After 18 months, the results speak for themselves: a 16% profit increase, and our clients recognise us again as the go-to experts in our original field. By cutting back on services that diluted our value, we’ve improved our financial performance, deepened our impact, established a better quality of life for us and the team, and discovered that saying ‘no’ to distractions is the key to realizing the full potential of our expertise.”

# 25 Positioning Lessons Every Consultancy Should Internalize

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 17 April 2023

---

I can’t say it enough – positioning matters.Consultancy positioning is the pivotal act of clarifying what problem(s) a consultancy is solving for which specific audience and how its approach is achieving that.A consultancy’s positioning is its strategy. As Michael Porter said: “Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it’s about deliberately choosing to be different”.How a consultancy designs its positioning and later communicates it both internally and externally will make or break a business.Perhaps not in a year, maybe not in even 2 or 3 years. But firms with weak positioning will inevitably find themselves in a downward spiral, chasing every possible opportunity, overstretched & overburdened.Some of them, I’ve seen it multiple times, are barely keeping their heads above water due to poor margins, caused by too low prices, project inefficiency (lack of repeatability), chaotic resource allocation (never sure about ‘the day after’), and high cost of client acquisition (chasing clients).That’s why I religiously share my advice on positioning via both the blog articles and LinkedIn posts.Here, I’d like to summarize the 25 LinkedIn posts I dedicated specifically to the subject of positioning. I hope all consulting leaders that read this post take their time to read through each piece of advice and lesson that I learned over the years.Sure, it’s better late than never to design laser-sharp positioning. But it’s even better now than later to do so.

## #ConsultingPositioningFriday Posts on LinkedIn

• Poorly positioned consultancies will struggle to explain typical outcomes of their work.Here, I explain the powerful difference between introducing a consultancy by explaining what it does versus highlighting what clients typically achieve when working with the firm.

• Most consultancy’s positioning sucks!Positioning is a foundational element. If a consultancy has weak positioning, it’ll negatively impact its business development, marketing, service development, client retention, and other vital processes.

• Recession looming? Time to review the consultancy’s positioning.Recession periods force established systems and processes in the state of shock. This presents lucrative opportunities for consultancies that are able to revise their positioning and pivot correctly.

• Consultancies must stop comparing themselves with competition.Strategic positioning of a consultancy does not depend on competitors. Rather, it depends on factors like a deep understanding of the target audience’s pain points, connecting these challenges with the problem-resolution capabilities of the firm, and becoming the go-to expert.

• Here’s a case study of a highly profitable consultancy.I provide real data and numbers from a mid-sized consultancy firm whose gross margin is way - WAY - above the market average, and explain how the firm was able to achieve that.

• Show me a consulting P&L, and I will explain the quality of the consultancy’s positioning, focus and specialisation.Here, I explain why profit margins of well positioned, narrowly focused and deeply specialised consulting firms almost always are significantly higher than that of consultancies that target multiple expertise domains in an effort to protect short-term revenue.

• One of the biggest mistakes in consulting: offering a Royal Buffet.Consultancies whose business development pipelines have stalled should first and foremost reevaluate their positioning. Those that try to cater to too wide an audience will inevitably face the problem of diminishing returns.

• Positioning in consulting is either driving growth or slowing it down.Great positioning in consulting drives growth. Poor positioning slows down growth. It’s as simple as that. Here, I explain why.

• Consultancy owners, with their great emotional commitment, often are the bottleneck for disciplined positioning.In an attempt to protect short-term revenue and, oftentimes, because of their egos, consultancy owners tend to say yes to all prospects. Over time, however, that dilutes positioning and negatively impacts the revenue and profits.

• Good news! The need to update a consultancy’s positioning is often a sign of growth.Going back to the drawing board and reevaluating a consultancy’s positioning is not necessarily bad news. Quite the opposite – often, it’s a sign that a firm has outgrown its current positioning and should pivot towards a more profitable strategy."The problem is not the crowded consulting market, the problem is the consultant. In a world full of self-acclaimed experts, don’t ever think that your consulting services are what you think they are but what they do for your client. It’s not what it is but what it does. Never forget that sentence again!"

• Deliberately withholding information? Consultancies are fooling themselves.Consultancies that invest time and effort into sharpening their positioning should not withhold that information from the public. In fact, they should proudly declare their new positioning on the website, marketing collaterals, in conversations with prospects – everywhere. Keeping all options open is foolish.

• Take a deep breath, narrow the focus and become the very best, top-of-mind consultancy for just ONE thing.The ultimate goal a consultancy should have for its business development is prospects inviting to complete projects as a result of a reputational footprint as a consultancy. However, that’s never going to happen for firms that are not known as the go-to experts in a narrow field.

• Poorly positioned consulting firms have no choice but to compete on pricing.Here, I provide a quick list of self-assessment questions that will tell whether a consultancy needs to get more explicit about the target audience and its problems to be solved.

• A common mistake consultancies make in difficult economic times?Creating a bunch of new services to catch more opportunities is a common mistake consultancies make when panicking about revenue in tough economic times. However, it’s a risky game that most likely will cause more damage to revenue long-term.

• Prospects will struggle to get approval for working with a poorly positioned consultancy.The “we-we-we” stories that consultancies tell their prospects don’t get the internal approvals in the prospects’ businesses. What does? The “here are the pain points we can solve for you” and “here is what your business will be able to achieve” stories do get those approvals.

• Breaking the myth: a narrowly positioned consultancy can still offer a wide range of services.Through two examples of former clients, I explain the difference between offering a wide range of services as a generalist firm and offering an integrated, connected set of services as a narrowly positioned consultancy.

• A laser-sharp positioning as a consultancy is the foundation of rock-solid employer branding.Prospects are not the only ones who check out potential consultancies. Candidates do as well. And top talent wants to work with firms that have the reputation for excellence and deep subject matter expertise.

• Laser-sharp positioning drives a consultancy’s efficiency and profit.Well-positioned consultancies are more likely to achieve a much higher degree of decoupling value delivery from the effort. For them, there’s no direct relationship between revenue growth and headcount increase.

• Luk, how to answer the question ‘Why should we hire your consultancy?’This question often puts consulting leaders in the defensive mode and, as a result, prompts generic answers about the years of experience and the wide range of services offered. Consultancies that have a strong trust base with their audience, on the other hand, don’t get asked this question. The target audience already knows.

• Swim lanes are there for a reason, yet consultancy co-owners frequently jump lanes.Way too often, consulting leaders jump lanes – say yes to opportunities that are outside of the internally agreed-upon positioning. It’s tempting but, ultimately, damages the business."Without a strong positioning as the go-to experts in the market, consultancies will get pulled into everyday commodity work, taking orders from lower level team members of the client, getting measured on ‘hours performed’ instead of ‘outcomes delivered’. At low rates, beaten up by procurement. With inferior profit. Totally unattractive for top talent. Heck."

• Is the expertise of your consultancy perceived as an essential spend?When prospects trim out the non-essential spending, consulting firms that are worried about its impact on their business should go back to their positioning and determine why their services are deemed as non-essential. Clearly, the positioning requires some serious revisions.

• The positioning book ‘Obviously Awesome’ had a significant impact on me. The author: April Dunford.The book's subtitle: “How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It”. While the book is targeted primarily at tech companies, the positioning insights and strategies in the book are highly relevant to consulting.

• What is the link between consultancy positioning and my gravel bike?This is a reminder to consultancy owners and consulting leaders to think WHY they are in business. Ultimately, it’s to have the life we want. And if business development and growth are not helping achieve this ultimate goal, it’s time to revise how the business is being operated. And that starts with the positioning.

• Here’s how a BPE approach transforms consultancy positioning.BPE stands for ‘Bridging-Problem-to-Expertise’. It’s a way to get rid of meaningless, generic, vague language that too many consultancies utilize. It’s a way to communicate the value- and problem-resolution-driven approach of a firm.

• The story of a consultancy cutting back 30% of services and improving its profitability.It’s a summary of how a consultancy I’ve been following for the last 6 years managed to pivot its positioning and implement a strategy that allowed it to achieve stronger results with (eventually) less effort.

"The problem is not the crowded consulting market, the problem is the consultant. In a world full of self-acclaimed experts, don’t ever think that your consulting services are what you think they are but what they do for your client. It’s not what it is but what it does. Never forget that sentence again!"

## In conclusion

Consulting firms that:

• rarely receive invitations and requests for expertise

• struggle with tough client objections

• hardly ever say No to incoming opportunities irrespective of how relevant they are to the core business

• constantly feel the need to twist the expertise narrative to ease the pitch

• regularly offer discounts to close a prospect

• struggle to provide transformational case studies

should take a long hard look at their positioning. These are just a few symptoms of a poorly positioned consultancy.And, unfortunately, this downward spiral of barely getting enough projects to sustain a business will continue until the consultancy implodes.Recommended reading:Positioning in Consulting Is an Exercise in Irrelevance and Here’s Why

# The 5 Main Challenges Almost Every Consultancy Struggles With

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 16 April 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-5-main-challenges-almost-every-consultancy-struggles-with

---

This article was last updated on 16 April 2023.

In the past couple of years, I’ve audited the positioning and business development models of 50+ consultancies. In addition, I had in-depth conversations with 100+ leaders of consulting firms of various sizes on the challenges they face, trying to get to the root of the problem.

There are many similarities in the struggles that consulting leaders report having in their business development efforts. The ones I’d like to focus on today have been coming up most often and most prominently.

## The foundation of my assessment process that consultancies can replicate

I’m not going to dive into the details of my assessment process in this post. While it’s a straightforward process, it does deserve elaboration to do it justice, and that’s not what this article is about.

However, I would like to share a bit about what lies at the foundation of my assessment process – checking the extent to which the market perception of a consultancy matches the expectations and business growth aspirations of that firm.

More specifically, I try to understand the following:

• How a consultancy markets itself

• How they recruit new clients

• What their existing client profile is vs. what their ideal client profile is

• How their marketing message and business development efforts are perceived by the ideal clients

• What internal processes the firm has in place to produce and communicate its positioning

• Whether there is alignment across teams – from practice leaders to individual consultants, to marketing executives, to entry-level researchers – on what the positioning is and how it is communicated

• Whether there are any gaps or silos in the way positioning is communicated to existing and prospective clients

More often than not, I discover that the problems consultancies come to me with are not really superficial.

It rarely comes down to picking out the wrong social media channels for marketing campaigns or failing to track a metric or two.

Usually, the problems consultancies come to me with are symptoms of larger issues embedded in everything they do.

And here are the five big underlying challenges that I witness most consultancies struggle with and my advice on overcoming them.

## Challenge #1: substandard positioning

Without strong positioning, a consultancy’s target market has no clear idea of what exactly they do, how they do it, and why what they do is of value for the target audience.

Moreover, such firms do not have a proper framework to organize their priorities, client work, educational efforts, and business development processes.

Weak positioning makes firms take on any incoming projects just to fill up the pipeline of client work. It dilutes the value of expertise and forces consulting companies to lower their fees to compete for work.

Substandard positioning impacts every marketing action – every message, every post, and every speaking engagement. There is no single, laser-sharp message that everyone in the company communicates and works towards reinforcing.

Without strong positioning, client referrals and case studies fail to demonstrate the unique value of a consultancy.

I can go on for a long time.

But let’s get to the solution.

> “Your narrow positioning is an exercise in irrelevance. The more irrelevant you become to non-ideal prospects by turning your positioning away from them, the more relevant you become to your chosen target clients. But that requires courage and discipline”. - David C. Baker

“Your narrow positioning is an exercise in irrelevance. The more irrelevant you become to non-ideal prospects by turning your positioning away from them, the more relevant you become to your chosen target clients. But that requires courage and discipline”. - David C. Baker

### How to address the problem of substandard positioning

I recommend that consultancies think long and hard about their target audience.

Who are they? What are their prototypical pain points? What results do they expect? Are their pain points superficial, or do they point to larger problems that must be addressed in a larger context?

I urge consultancies to regularly conduct structured client research to be aware of what’s happening with their target audience.

Once the target audience is crystalized, the positioning should be developed based on the value proposition that’s problem-resolution-based.

Consultancies shouldn’t consider positioning reviews as a mundane task of fixing a problem.

Positioning reviews and updates are great. I love them. Because it’s a sign of growth, development, reflection, of getting in sync with new evolutions in the market.

Whether it’s because the current positioning is weak or because a firm has outgrown its current positioning, re-working this foundational element is making progress. It’s a symptom of taking the consulting business to the next level.

Positioning is never set in stone. On the contrary.

A consultancy might have been primarily focused on execution-type of work. However, over the years, the consultancy’s expertise has deepened and achieved a higher level of involvement, strategic advisory – upstream-type of work.

Positioning should reflect this upward growth.

## Challenge #2: strong inward view

The inward view is a typical stumble block for consulting firms. It’s (another) side-effect of suboptimal positioning because a strong positioning will always pull towards client-centered thinking.

I learned that consultants and consultancies have a tough time getting rid of their inside view: “We are the best in this”, We are the best in that”, “We are unique”, “We are award-winning”, “We have a collective experience of X years”, “We are innovative, leading, passionate, result-focused, client-centered, and fascinated about teamwork” – to name a few examples.

It’s often driven by pride, passion, or a strong belief in expertise and sometimes by egos. I get that. I’ve been there.

But here’s the thing.

No one is interested in this we-we-we show. Clients and prospects don’t care that a firm has a zillion years of combined experience. They care if a firm has a proven track record of solving a very specific problem (this could be the case with only a few years of experience).

Prospects don’t care if a consultancy is calling itself unique. They care whether the consultancy has the expertise to fully grasp a problem and provide targeted advice.

Clients want results. They want to trust their consulting partner. They want experts whose knowledge far exceeds the knowledge the client has internally.

It’s ALL about the client and the client’s needs. The inward, self-centered view is useless.

### How to address the problem of the inward view

It should be clear by now – firms need to flip the messaging inside out.

The client-centered narrative should be at the forefront of every communication. The service offering should shift from output-driven (‘here’s what we do’) to outcome-driven (’here’s what can be achieved).

The language should seamlessly integrate the prototypical challenges of the target audience.

Consulting firms need to shift the focus from themselves and their ‘unique services' to the problems and pains of their prospects and clients.

Here’s what I recommend consulting firms think and talk about as they draft their communication – be it a social media post, a website copy, an email to a prospect, or a case study:

• Where's the client in all this?

• Which clients are the focus of all the messaging?

• What are the pains of the client the firm can transform?

• What specific transformation can the consulting firm deliver for those prototypical pains?

• What is the firm’s point of view about this prototypical client pain?

• What is the value or impact the consultants of the firm will have?

• Where’s the firm’s value proposition?

• Where is the consultancy’s specific social proof linked to the value proposition?

• Where’s the firm’s educational effort and pain-resolution advice?

Consultancies need to take a step back and re-evaluate and rewrite their messaging to put the ideal client in the center of it.

## Challenge #3: hitting the project wall

‘Hitting the project wall’ is typical in project-driven consulting firms.

And, unfortunately, too many consultancies never get over this ‘project wall’. They wish to become strategic advisors but get stuck in lower-value project work at a low level of involvement.

Most consultancies are telling me they have the ambition to move upstream.

However, it's not easy if a consulting firm has been doing downstream project work for a very long time.

The team is experienced in doing project work (and got hired to do project work), and the external perception of this consultancy as a project firm is difficult to change.

And moving more upstream and doing strategy work (going for premium pricing) after years of (lower) project pricing could also cause a few stupefied client faces.

However, consultancies with upstream-work ambition have to make the active push to jump over the wall and transform their market image as an advisory-driven firm deeply rooted in a very narrow area of expertise.

Once on the other side of the wall, it will be able to reach the next level of business growth.

It’s the level where a firm takes on only ideal clients, easily saying no to all irrelevant opportunities. It’s when a firm charges premium fees because of being in high demand for their deep expertise and the transformational impact of their work.

It’s when a firm gets invited to take on a client as opposed to having to bid on (lower rate) projects and sending endless follow-up emails.

### How to address the problem of hitting the project wall

What I have experienced in the past decade in consulting is an almost inescapable downstream pull towards smaller projects at lower revenue.

This is leading to the following:

• high lead generation pressure to keep the engine going, and

• overall annual revenue per FTE substantially below market averages.

This downstream pull, however, is another side-effect of suboptimal positioning. Really.

Ambitions to become a more upstream, more strategic, premium pricing consultancy? My short advice would be to build an action plan to jump over the wall more permanently with the following:

• Developing a discovery audit. The discovery audit helps companies understand their improvement opportunities in a specific (strategic) domain, e.g., supply chain inventory improvements, cyber security risk analysis, data analysis feasibility study, etc.

The delivery ‘product’ is a roadmap with a summary of the improvement areas and recommendations.

Based on the consultancy’s internal capacity (people), they can decide (reverse-engineer) how much of such a roadmap they can offer to implement.

It’s a Trojan Horse to enter organizations and move upstream with consulting work.

• Developinga ‘building the function’ value proposition. Most consulting firms don’t have a specific value proposition to help organizations ‘build the function’ (or improve, which can also be included in the discovery audit). An example from my consulting days in People Analytics (PA): the PA discipline (and function) was in the early stages of maturity in most companies between 2010 and 2018. We've helped many organizations with establishing the PA function, solving all kinds of questions related to the structure of the function, the business case to build the function, the needed expertise, the role/job descriptions, and much more.

It took me a while to understand the power of such work in moving upstream and crossing the project wall. I’d say: reflect on this. It’s an ideal ‘breaking through the wall’ proposition.

• Aligning the team behind this upstream move, most likely also hiring different profiles in the future (because of the project expertise and not the strategic experience), and making the team (more) aware of the impact of the current lead-gen pressure (lots of smaller revenue projects)

## Challenge #4: content that doesn’t generate demand

I’m an avid proponent of educating the audience to grow a consulting business.

It’s not a feel-good strategy. It’s a proven business development and marketing approach that, in the digital age, not only remains relevant but only grows in its importance.

However, firms that put audience education at the forefront of their marketing activities should not fail to do so based on a demand-gen strategy.

I’ve seen dozens of firms produce truly expertise-driven content yet see no meaningful results.

Because they fail to succinctly explain the consultancy’s transformative approach that will allow clients to move from their pain-ridden state to ‘The Promised Land’.It’s all about creating a bold vision about the potential of switching to a new, different approach.The vision of the consulting firm should be contagious. What the consultancy ‘sells’ is not what it is, but what it does for the client (never forget this sentence!).

For example, it’s not enough to say, “This is trend X for the upcoming year.” To generate business opportunities, consultancies need to go further.

How is this trend going to impact the target audience? What should be done to prepare for this trend? Why is there the urgency to take action NOW, before the trend settles in? What opportunities does the target audience miss out on by not doing XYZ?

In addition to being educational, content needs to be action-driven.

### How to address the problem of content that doesn't generate demand

To create the demand for the consultancy’s expertise, it’s critical to consistently cover these three perspectives linked to the firm’s value proposition:

• Shifting the potential client’s thinking: bringing hidden problems and patterns to the surface, inspiring the audience to shift the way they think about their fundamental or underlying innovation challenges.

• Picturing the transformational potential: creating a bold vision about the transformational potential of switching to a new, different approach (e.g. getting future-ready).

• Explaining the cost of inaction: explaining opportunity costs or costs of maintaining the status quo. The target audience doesn’t want to hear what they already know about their problems.

The target audience needs to be motivated to take action. Education doesn’t stop at explaining what’s happening. It further educates on the impact of what’s happening and what will happen in the future.

Only true experts can foresee and deliver this type of educational content.

*Recommended reading:Shaping Your Consultancy’s Thought Leadership To Accelerate Growth*

## Challenge #5: missing voices of consulting leaders

It keeps surprising me immensely. Consulting leaders and partners have always hesitated to openly share their bold opinions and experiences.

Does being open threaten their power base? Are they afraid to get criticized? Have those leaders ‘made it to the top’ and no longer care about their voice?

Or are they intentionally silent to keep all options open, avoiding getting ‘boxed’ into a particular expertise domain, industry, or management role?

Sometimes it’s that. Sometimes it’s the refusal to make the time to create thought leadership audience-education-based content regularly.

This is so damn wrong as a consulting leader, and it is a very shortsighted vision.

No wonderspecialized boutique consultancies with ‘new school’ consulting leaders(openly educating their audience) can crush the bigger guys when pitching.

### How to address the problem of missing voices of consulting leaders

The best consultants I meet are also exceptional teachers.

They educate their buyers/clients, share best practices with them, tell them what trends to look out for, consistently share valuable advice on achieving success, and demonstrate how they’ve helped others in their shoes.

Remember genius Richard Feynman:“The ultimate test of who you are is your capacity to transfer knowledge to others”.

Consulting leaders that have made it to the top have a unique opportunity to widely share their leading thoughts and attract new high-end clients for their consultancies.

People buy from people with a leading voice that builds trust and shifts their thinking about the everyday challenges they face. Right?

Consulting leaders, your story is more important than you think.

Your inimitable ‘background story’ as a consultant - the clients you’ve worked with, the knowledge you’ve accumulated over the years, and the types of projects you’ve completed - are all part of your overall, distinctive value proposition.

Here’s my advice on sharing thought leadership content in a way that converts to business development success.

• Never focus on self-promotion. Here is the watch out: instead of self-promoting blah blah in he/she format, you will need to connect the dots between your background story and your client-centered value proposition.In other words, everything you learned all those years about those specific pain points of your ideal clients will add tremendous value to their future problem-solving journey.

• Always focus on problem resolution. And this background story, therefore, is always problem-resolution focused: what did you learn all those years that the client can leverage to solve their pain/problem? Your consulting expertise is probably not truly exceptional, but you certainly are. Therefore, ‘the you’ is indispensable to the consultancy’s overall value proposition.

## In conclusion

The five problems I outlined today are all at the foundational level. That means they usually lead to many issues throughout a consulting business.

To achieve sustainable, predictable business growth, consultancies should not focus on the symptoms but use them to understand why they are in their current position.

Only by building a strong foundation can consulting firms adjust every other process and business development effort to consistently deliver results. Only by aligning all teams around the strong core can consulting firms maximize the return on every message, proposal, and campaign.

# Relying On the Network Is A High-Risk Consulting Growth Strategy

"Luk, growing our consultancy is all about the business networks of consultants and consulting leaders and the relationships.”

I’ve heard variations of this statement more times than I can count.

However, in my experience, heavily relying on the network and relationships as a business development strategy results in an unreliable pipeline and unpredictable future.

In an overcrowded consulting market, digital is how new business is won.

> "The traditional marketing model in the professional services industry is in trouble. Client loyalty, satisfaction and referrals are in a slow downward spiral. The old strategies and techniques won't cut it anymore. A modern, digital-fueled content marketing approach, however, hits all the right notes." (Hinge Research Institute)

## The 8 disadvantages of a relationship-first approach to business development

There is nothing wrong with nurturing and growing a business network and relationships. Hell, I’m a big network guy myself. Don’t get me wrong!

As a keynote speaker at 100+ conferences, I never missed the opportunity to meet prospects and add them to my network.

Back in my people analytics days, I used to have access to an incredible amount of CHRO’s and people analytics leaders in my markets and it had helped me tremendously growing my consulting business.

However, I was never reliant on my network ONLY to grow my consulting business. Building relationships was never my ultimate goal but rather the result of my expertise, my visibility and reputation on the market.

Consultancies that heavily skew their business development efforts towards relationship-building place numerous limitations on their business growth.

Figure 1: The consulting growth quadrant. Too much focus on Relationships is risky!

### 1. Consultancies have very low control over their networks

Activating a network is not easy. Sure, consulting leaders can try to keep their contacts warm, comment on their LinkedIn posts, engaging with them on- and offline, but when it comes to actually getting the business network to 'deliver', problems begin.

Turns out that there is a budgetary issue with one, a lack of expertise fit with another, a timing problem with the third one. And on and on it goes.

The 'call to arms' is weak, unpredictable, inconsistent and not scalable.

### 2. There is inherent churn risk

Consulting leaders may have solid relationships, but people switch jobs all the time.

Putting all eggs in the ‘building relationships’ basket means that when a contact moves out of a certain position, the consulting leader has to start all over again with the new person.

### 3. A consultancy's network's demographics can get out of sync

Research confirms there's a strong correlation between our demographics and the demographics of clients. As David Burkus in HBR (see below) states, people seem to connect with those similar to them.

This means, over time, a consultancy will get out of sync with the new/younger generation and with people not-so-similar to the consultancy's internal demographic.

The business network will grow old. Step by step, the consulting firm will get more disconnected without even knowing it.

> "Most of us, when put into a situation where the only goal is to meet new people, default to staying inside of our comfort zones. That means talking to people we already know. Or at the very least people who are similar to us. That means most networking is doomed from the start, by its very design." (David Burkus in HBR)

"Most of us, when put into a situation where the only goal is to meet new people, default to staying inside of our comfort zones. That means talking to people we already know. Or at the very least people who are similar to us. That means most networking is doomed from the start, by its very design." (David Burkus in HBR)

### 4. Business networks tend to have too much noise

Just how many contacts in a consulting leader's network are the firm's ideal clients? 1%? 5%? 10% (at best)? Keeping a business network 100% relevant is impossible. The more it grows, the more noise slips in.

This results in outreach efforts delivering very poor ROIs. This time should instead be invested in strengthening the other components of the consulting growth quadrant.

Cutting through the noise takes time, and time is the one thing most consulting leaders do not have.

*Recommended reading:The 5 Main Challenges Almost Every Consultancy Struggles With*

### 5. Consulting firms waste too much time trying to impress their contacts

Oh the endless wining-and-dining sessions. So much time can get wasted schmoozing potential clients.

> Too many consultants who I've met in the past, practice 'wining and dining' with sales as their end goal. Unfortunately, if selling is your goal during such network 'meetings', you’re going about it all wrong. If you quantify your network as sales targets, you'll be uncovered as sleazy sooner or later.

Too many consultants who I've met in the past, practice 'wining and dining' with sales as their end goal. Unfortunately, if selling is your goal during such network 'meetings', you’re going about it all wrong. If you quantify your network as sales targets, you'll be uncovered as sleazy sooner or later.

Every consulting leader gets the "I'd like to pick your brain" lunch invite that turns into a two-hour session of offering free advice with little to show for it.

I’m a big advocate of educating the target audience by sharing knowledge freely and generously. However, it should be done as part of a business development strategy, where the consulting firm can measure the reach, the impact, the number of leads generated, etc.

Digital is how new business is won.

### 6. Consultancies fail to create a systemic approach to nurturing their networks

Nurturing a business network requires structurally sharing new trends, learnings, and social proof to build trust in the specific area of expertise.

The most important goal of all: to bring the network 'into the system' and structurally nurture them.

For more than a decade, I've been sending regular updates to my network to keep them in the loop on the latest trends, new case studies (=social proof), my brand-new learnings, etc.

I've always done so in a structured way via mailings and newsletters sent out to mysubscribers(read: to my 'in-the-system' network and relationships).

I strongly recommend that consultancies strive to move the network/relationships from a 70-80% non-systemized audience to a 70-80% systemized audience. A big shift, a new mindset.

Firms should utilize aDELIBERATEstrategy to do so. That’s what I’ve done all those years: 90% of people in my network got ‘systemized’.

I've always been obsessed with 'getting them into the system' in order to be able to nurture them in a scalable way.

This is how every consultancy should treat networks and relationships!

*Recommended reading:Building an Email List Is Consultancies' Ultimate Trust Weapon*

### 7. Consultancies can't collect data and make data-driven decisions

“Data is king!” – an overused but 100% true saying.

A business network can’t be systematically assessed from a data point. What are the metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of a firm's or its leaders' business development within the relationships-only framework?

For example, when I share my content, I measure:

• how many people consume my content?

• where they come from (source, e.g. social media, organic, etc.)?

• what exactly they read (most important topics)?

• how long they stay engaged (longer page visits help me rank better in Google search results and assess the quality of my content)?

• which promotional channels attract which kind of audience(s)?

• how many people (and who) click on my CTA (call to action) button(s) (e.g. subscribe, book a call, etc.)?

• how many people convert to subscribers or to clients?

• ...and a dozen other metrics.

I do an in-depth weekly review to continuously improve my content and its distribution. Can a consultancy adopt the same rigorous data-driven approach in its relationships-first tactics? It's difficult. Close to impossible.

### 8. Consulting firms fail to build credentials and social proof in a methodical way

Last but not least is the challenge of setting up a methodized credential building and social proof process. If a consultancy'sreputation is based on word-of-mouth only, it will be extremely difficult to grow the business.

When a big chunk of marketing time is spent on 'wining and dining' prospects, very little of it is left to create a scalable system of consistently adding project work, visibility credentials (e.g. speaking at events, getting interviewed, etc.) and social proof (e.g. case studies, problem-resolution referrals, recommendations for your expertise, etc.) to the portfolio.

Establishing and growing a reputational footprint through expertise-driven audience education, on the other hand, is a scalable, methodical business development model.

## Relationships can become a liability

Last year I met with a highly successful consulting firm that relied heavily on the networks and relationships of its top executives. These executives had built up a vast network of contacts over the years and had a reputation for getting things done.“That’s how we grew our business all those years, Luk”, the consulting leader told me. And indeed, the firm enjoyed tremendous growth and success for many years.However, a few months before we met, two of the firm's key executives left to start a new consulting firm. They took many of their contacts and relationships with them, leaving the consulting firm with a significant hole in its network.Suddenly, the firm found itself struggling to generate new business and struggling to keep up with its competitors. That was the starting point for our meeting.The lesson here is clear: relying too heavily on networks and relationships can be a high-risk growth strategy for consulting firms. While it may work in the short term, it leaves the firm vulnerable to losing key executives and the erosion of its network over time.

## A low-risk business growth approach that will give consultancies a more reliable pipeline

A relationships-only approach to business development in consulting is a losing game. It’s unreliable and comes with too many long-term risks.

What IS a winning growth strategy, on the other hand, is expanding the approach.

### Figure 2: The consulting growth quadrant. Widen the green circle, an integrated approach.

### 1. Positioning should come first

First and foremost, consultancies need to find a way to differentiate from competitors.

I recommend narrowing the focus and establishing expertise in a highly specialized area. A consultancy should be the go-to firm for a narrow group of people. Yes, this shrinks the pool of potential clients, but it also drastically increases the appeal of the firm to the right audience.

> Poorly positioned consultancies will always struggle with a multitude of business development goals. They often get under mental pressure to start selling downstream availability (order takers instead of transformational experts) and usually start overservicing the clients at too low a price.Poor positioning is a losing battle in both visibility and trust-building with prospects.Stop going there. There’s too much saturation in the crowded, competitive consulting market, too many competitors doing the same thing.

There’s too much saturation in the crowded, competitive consulting market, too many competitors doing the same thing.

The more specialized a consultancy is, the fewer competitors it has. The deeper the firm's expertise on a subject, the more prospects will be reaching out (as opposed to having to chase after prospects).

*Recommended reading:A Consultancy's Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying Decision*

### 2. Growing the reputational footprint through expertise-led audience education come second

Once a consulting firm has clearly defined its positioning on the market, it can start building and growing its reputational footprint as the ultimate expert on a subject matter.

This is the time to create, create, create – blog articles, trainings, case studies, conference presentations, guest posts, etc. All the efforts should be driven by the relentless desire to educate the target audience. This content should address the most pressing issues the target audience faces, provide answers to questions that keep the prospects up at night.

> "Are you generous with your content? If you are not, you are losing! Generosity is an engine for going viral. The more you share, the more you will grow. Selfishness doesn’t spread”. (Josh Spector, social media expert)

"Are you generous with your content? If you are not, you are losing! Generosity is an engine for going viral. The more you share, the more you will grow. Selfishness doesn’t spread”. (Josh Spector, social media expert)

And, of course, this content should be promoted over and over again.

### 3. Social proof comes third

The claims that a consultancy makes about its expertise should always be backed up. The most efficient way to do so is via case studies and transformational recommendations.

As soon as a consultancy completes a project, the consultant in charge should always do two things:

• Case Study:Write up a case study, focusing on a specific pain that the consultancy resolved for its client (getting the proper permissions from the client, of course, or anonymizing the client)

• Recommendation:Consultants should ask for a recommendation that describes the client transformation (instead of 'being a nice person to work with') achieved during the project journey

Once the firm has its case studies and transformational recommendations, it must put a spotlight on them. Add them to the content, to the website, and LinkedIn profiles. Share, share, share.

The buzz generated around the expertise-driven educational content will convert into leads and clients much more efficiently when backed up by solid social proof.

### 4. Relationships- and network-building comes last

Yes, this business growth strategy should come last. It should not be consultancies' ultimate goal but a natural result of a clearly defined (narrow) positioning, growing the reputational footprint and gathering transformational social proof.

And here's the thing. If a consultancy does the first three things right, it will barely have to spend any time on this because clients will be coming to the firm.

That’s exactly what happened in my case. There was no need for wining and dining (was an exception!), free brain-picking, sleazy outbound communication, but rather screening and qualifying organically incoming leads. Consistently.

## Conclusion: 8 Reasons why relationships-first is a high-risk business development strategy for consultancies

• Consultancies have very low control over your network

• There is inherent churn risk

• A consultancy's network’s demographics can get out of sync

• Business network tend to have too much noise

• Consulting firms waste too much time trying to impress contacts

• Consultancies fail to create a systemic approach to nurturing their networks

• Consultancies can’t collect data and make data-driven decisions

• Consulting firms fail to build credentials and social proof in a methodical way

Consultancies that rely on relationships and networks as a business development tool face a high-risk future in a world dominated by online marketing. Competitors are only one click away!

Widening the green circle (see figure 2), gives consultancies pillars that they can comfortably rely on, which will reinforce each other, provide with a more constant stream of work and business growth opportunities, and will automatically strengthen business networks and relationships.

# The Way a Consultancy Manages Its Pipeline Is the Way It Manages the Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 22 March 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/pipeline-management-in-consulting

---

For a service business of any type, the pipeline of work is the most critical indicator of business health.

Consultancies are no exception. The pipeline represents potential revenue, growth opportunities, resource demands, and recruitment needs.However, managing a consulting pipeline effectively is a challenging feat. Consulting leaders must deeply understand their market, clients, service offering design, and internal capabilities.In my experience, there is a strong connection between how consultancies manage their pipelines and how they manage their business internally.If one is managed poorly, odds are, internal processes (be it new business development, project and scope management, internal task allocation, hiring and knowledge management, etc.) are managed just as poorly.Pipeline management and how it can be used as an indicator of consultancy management is the topic I’d like to dive into in this post.

## Pipeline management and forecasting in the consulting business

Pipeline forecasting and management – while two very different processes – are both challenging. Both require a disciplined and reliable approach to make sense of an inherently unpredictable business that is consulting due to such constantly changing factors as client needs, market conditions, and unexpected challenges.

### 10 reasons why consultancies find it challenging to forecast and manage their pipelines

This list is not exhaustive by any measure. However, it does include some of the most common reasons and complexities of pipeline forecasting and management.

• Uncertainty in project timelines: Consultancy projects often depend on external factors  – e.g., client availability, regulatory approvals, third-party resource availability – that can be difficult to predict, making it challenging to estimate project timelines with a high degree of accuracy.

• Inconsistent demand and ever-increasing competition: Many consulting leaders note the unpredictability of client demand for consultancy services, coupled with competition increasing daily, leading to pipeline fluctuations and making it difficult to forecast revenue.

• Limited resources: Most consultancies have limited resources, including staff, third-party solutions utilised during projects, and/or budget considerations. This requires pipeline management to balance competing demands for time, attention, and other resources.

• Complex sales cycles: Sales cycles for consultancy projects can be long and involve various layers of engagement across multiple stakeholders and decision-makers, making it difficult to manage and predict the pipeline.

• Changing market dynamics: Market trends and customer needs can shift quickly, making it challenging to stay ahead of the curve and deliver services that meet evolving demands.

• Staffing challenges: Consultancy projects often require specialised expertise, and finding the right talent with the necessary skills and experience can be difficult, particularly in a competitive market.

• Client retention: Building long-term relationships with clients is essential for the success of a consultancy, but retaining clients can be challenging, particularly if they are dissatisfied with the quality of service or value proposition.

• Financial management: Consultancies often have complex financial arrangements, including fee structures, billing schedules, and payment terms that require careful management to maintain cash flow and profitability.

• Balancing quality and efficiency: Consultancies need to balance the need for high-quality services with the need to deliver projects efficiently and cost-effectively, which can be a delicate balancing act that requires careful planning and execution.

• Ensuring internal alignment: Any pipeline management prioritises resources, client projects, etc. This proves challenging when a consulting business lacks the ability/willingness to communicate and justify priorities effectively.

## Pipeline management and forecasting are exponentially more challenging for unfocused consultancies.

As complex the processes of managing and forecasting pipelines are, they become infinitely more difficult for businesses that do not have a clear focus on their work. Such focus offers a buffet of services to a giant pool of prospects.

• Lack of clarity on target clients: If a consultancy does not understand its target audience and needs, it will struggle to generate consistent demand and build a reliable pipeline.

• Pursuing too many opportunities: If a consulting firm pursues too many opportunities simultaneously (none of which deliver high profitability margins), it will spread itself too thin and struggle to devote sufficient resources to any project, leading to delays and missed deadlines.

> "What consultants need is the confidence that "the void" that is created by saying no, becomes an opportunity to do things that bring them further and closer to what they want to do. And with that comes the confidence that something else will come along, because they're worth it". (David Ducheyne, founder of Otolith Consulting)

• Failure to prioritise tasks: If a consultancy does not have a clear focus, which means the ability to say no to non-ideal clients, it will struggle to prioritise incoming requests and, subsequently, tasks effectively.

• Ineffective communication and weak internal alignment: Unfocused consultancies will always struggle to communicate a crystal-clear value-proposition-driven message to their clients and internal stakeholders. This will inevitably result in the consultancy struggling to build trust and maintain reliable relationships and overworked/dissatisfied employees.

• Lack of strategic planning: Consulting firms that try to cater to too broad an audience with a long list of services will fail to have a clear strategic plan that outlines its goals and priorities. It will not have the foundation for decision-making when determining which opportunities to pursue, making pipeline forecasting all the more difficult.

## The link between pipeline management and high-quality consultancy management

Having conducted dozens of assessments of consulting firms’ pipeline management and forecasting processes, I have yet to come across a firm that does a poor job of managing and predicting their pipelines yet doesn’t have the same issues in consultancy management.

These processes are strongly and inherently tied together.Here are a few dimensions of high-quality pipeline management and forecasting and how they instantly translate to consultancy management.

### Pipeline management success dimensions

Let’s look at the sales process.

#### A clear and consistent sales process with standard stages helps ensure that all deals are accurately tracked and managed.

Firms that fail to set up and standardise the system cannot effectively track and optimise the work of their sales, marketing, and business development executives. It will make it difficult to track and evaluate the performance of employees in these departments, provide actionable feedback, and determine whether there are inefficiencies or skill gaps.

#### Accurate and up-to-date data about each deal, including deal size, probability of closure, and expected close date.

Similarly, firms that fail to measure their sales pipeline accurately inevitably struggle to determine how to efficiently allocate resources internally, which includes the projected time commitments of employees – the consultants.

#### Regular pipeline reviews (weekly, monthly, and quarterly) ensure all deals progress and any issues or bottlenecks can be identified and addressed promptly.

Call me crazy, but firms that do not bother to regularly review their sales pipelines and identify and address problem areas most likely take the same “hands-off” approach to managing employees.The reviews of employees’ performance tend not to be a priority. Regular assessments of skill gaps – not really. Listening to employees' feedback and determining how to address the issues brought up – only when things reach a boiling point.

A positive internal culture builds a more realistic pipeline management and forecast.

A positive internal culture, marked by openness and honesty, is crucial for accurately assessing deal closures in consultancy pipeline management. In environments where transparency and alignment are prioritised, teams feel comfortable discussing the realistic prospects of deals without the pressure of inflated expectations or internal politics. This honesty prevents the pipeline from becoming a vanity tool, where deals are overestimated for appearances rather than accurate planning and forecasting. On the other hand, a culture plagued by pressure, politics, and misalignment leads to an unreliable pipeline, hampering effective decision-making and strategic planning.

### Pipeline forecasting success dimensions

Let’s look at the sales forecasting process and its success dimensions.

#### A consistent methodology for evaluating and forecasting deals in a standardised way.

Consulting firms that cannot standardise the evaluation and forecasting method typically offer a buffet of services. They tend to cater to too broad an audience, chase prospects with never-ending follow-ups, and offer discounts as a way to compete.This type of business development strategy typically leads to quite a bit of stress and unpredictability, which, in turn, impacts consulting leaders’ ability to manage their teams effectively.

#### A data-driven approach based on historical data and current trends.

Data is king, but only when data collection strategies have been standardised and aggregated over time. Unfortunately, firms that do not have a clear – and narrow – expertise focus often end up with meaningless data. It’s spread across a vast audience pool and has too many opportunities to show reliable trends and patterns. This leaves consulting leaders with nothing more than a gut feeling to make forecasting calls.It comes as no surprise that this leads to utterly inefficient budgeting of resources. Consultants end up overworked for periods and underutilised for others. The same goes for whatever software solutions the firm uses, support staff, and everything else.

#### Disciplined adjustment for probability and risk to provide a more accurate view of revenue potential.

An accurate projection of revenue enables consulting leaders to make well-planned decisions. Is there a 20% growth expected towards the end of the year? Perhaps it’s a good idea to recruit new employees 3 months in advance to ensure they are up to speed and hit the ground running when the time comes. Without accurate revenue projections, teams go through turbulent times, utilisation of resources is not optimised, and client deliverables get delayed.

#### Involvement of multiple stakeholders, including sales, finance, and consulting leaders (of course).

This brings me back to the issue of internal alignment. Consulting leaders who manage their teams effectively understand the value of such alignment and strive for it in every aspect of business. Forecasting is a critical aspect of the business.Consultancies can use these success dimensions to assess their performance. That’s how I do it when I do my consultancy performance audits. It can tell a lot about the way a consultancy is managed.If a consultancy can’t manage and forecast a consulting pipeline in a disciplined and reliable way, it might be a good idea to look under the hood of the business.Recommended reading:(Case Study) Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy

## Setting the proper habits from the start

Setting the proper pipeline forecasting and management habits is never too early.

If I had known 15 years ago (when I started my first consultancy) what I know today, I would have started with pipeline management and forecasting from Day 1.Why?Well, relatively straightforward: to avoid sleepless nights when you have to run the payroll at the end of the month. Cash flow predictability becomes extremely important once the consultancy has a few people on the team. And that's where pipeline management comes into play.Pipeline management is an essential aspect of running a successful consultancy, and it forced me in the past to think about strategy, target audience, service offering, leadership alignment, team management, resource planning, internal culture, sales capacity, existential health, etc.It's a core component when determining how to ensure a steady workflow and revenue. By tracking and forecasting the pipeline, a consultancy can better plan for staffing needs and make more informed business decisions.In the early stages of a consultancy, pipeline management may be less complex, with fewer clients and projects to track. However, it is still important to establish processes and systems for managing the pipeline for future success.At a later stage (but still early enough), I would always invest in software or infrastructure to ensure the pipeline is effectively tracked and forecasted.I also strongly encourage consultancies to start tracking an opportunity as soon as it enters the sales process.This means the opportunity has been identified as a potential project or engagement, and there is a clear path forward for moving it through the sales process and into the pipeline.In consulting, most opportunities are generated by the business people (the consultants), so it's helpful to agree on a transparent process internally on how to activate it and by whom.What-when-how-who that's what needs to be agreed on. And that's easy but requires discipline and follow-up, given the financial implications.

## In conclusion

Over the years, I’ve worked with large and small consultancies, early-stage consultancies, and consultancies that have been in the game for a while now.I can’t remember a single example of a well-managed consultancy with substandard pipeline forecasting and management systems.Every successful business I audited had robust systems for almost every aspect of running their business.They had data at the tip of their fingers that they could seamlessly turn into insights. They could accurately predict revenue for the following 6 months and sometimes even 12 months. They planned, hired, and trained newcomers in advance, not in a reactive manner. They communicated to their teams what to expect, why, and the best way to achieve it.Last but not least, you guessed it, these successful consulting businesses had in common – they had a strong focus. They did not get distracted from it to chase irrelevant or non-ideal opportunities.

# Without Thought Leadership, Consultancies Will Fail

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 13 March 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/without-thought-leadership-consultancies-will-fail

---

Every year,Grist conducts researchinto thought leadership trends in the advisory industry. Hands down, this is one of the best thought leadership studies in the world.

I was able to get a sneak peek at the 2023 edition of the study. Without revealing too much information or all of the statistics, in this post, I’d like to comment on a few trends that consultancies MUST be aware of.

## Thought leadership is critical to decision-makers

• “Luk, we don’t have time to produce thought leadership content on a regular basis”

• “It doesn’t seem to make any impact, no matter how much we write”

• “Our older C-level prospects don’t read our thought leadership content”.

• “We don’t like revealing the secrets to how we work – why would anyone come to us if we just distribute all that knowledge for free?!”

Over the years, I’ve heard every excuse imaginable. And with every single person – be it a consulting leader or an individual consultant on a large team – I went through the same thought exercise that inevitably led to the same conclusion: you have no choice!

In this day and age, consulting firms simply can’t afford to be stingy with their knowledge. They can’t afford not to allocate time towards creating and executing an education-driven content strategy as part of their marketing and business development efforts.

I compared the numbers between the 2023 edition of the Grist study and the2020 edition. Three years. Not a lot of time. But the trend couldn’t be more obvious.

• In 2020:40%of senior executives said that thought leadership is critical in their decision-making when evaluating the suitability of a new advisor.

• In 2023:50%of senior executives said that thought leadership is critical in their decision-making when evaluating the suitability of a new advisor.

That’s a 10-point jump in just three years. Looking at the evolution of the market and buyers’ purchasing behavior changes in the last decade, I have absolutely no reason to believe that this upward trend will suddenly reverse itself in the next 5/10/15 years.

### Decision makers are more cautious than ever

Between the pandemic and the recession, decision makers have grown more cautious in the last few years. They are constantly looking for ways to reduce costs and maximize the value they get from outside partners.

As a result, there have been two major shifts in the purchasing behavior of decision-makers:

• More people than before are involved in the decision-making process on which partner/advisor/consultancy/vendor to hire.

• Senior executives want assurances of the value they will get from the consultancy they hire and sales decks and old-school pitches no longer cut it. Buyers do their own research now.

Consultancies that understand this shift in the way their prospects behave, do the following:

• They showcase their expertise viaeducational content that goes beyond superficial observations and dives deep into the pain points of prospects.

• They create content for anarrow audience, making this content significantly more impactful than if they were to target a more diluted audience.

• They demonstrate their value throughcase studies that show HOW they achieve results, not just WHAT results they achieved.

• Theyfurther shift the perspective of their audienceby helping them see the larger picture and how smaller pieces of a puzzle come together. This inspires action, which, in turn, leads to prospects converting to clients.

### Decision-makers are less loyal to current advisors than ever before

This increased cautiousness about which consultancy to hire also has translated into significantly less loyalty from clients. If they don’t think they’re working with industry experts, they will not hesitate to drop their current consultancy and switch to the one they perceive to be experts.

As the 2023 Grist study found:

• 78%of senior executives agree thatgood thought leadership would make them consider working with the advisoror solutions provider who produced it

• 72%agree that if their own advisor or solutions provider doesn’t produce thought leadership on their priorities,they’ll look at their competitors.

If this is not a reality check for consultancies that are stubborn about creating pain-resolution-driven educational content for their prospects AND current clients, I don’t know what is.

*Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Reach the Unconverted Audience in 4 Steps*

## Decision-makers’ expectations of thought leadership are rising

There is a lot of content out there. The digital space is a massive landfill of content. However, when it comes to thought leadership, only a tiny percentage would qualify as such.

Consultancies that want their content to make an impact on prospects – and get noticed in the first place – can’t skimp on quality.

According to Grist’s 2023 study, senior executives are looking for the following qualities in thought leadership content:

• 51%want it to be action-oriented (32%in 2020)

• 50%are looking for fresh thinking (32%in 2020)

• 48%want to see authenticity (28%in 2020)

The fact that there has been a drastic increase in buyers’ expectation for thought leadership pieces to have these qualities is not surprising.

Again, there is a ton of content senior executives can access within seconds. But the pieces they actually give the time a day inspire actions, present issues from a new perspective, and sound like they were written by an individual, not a corporate machine.

Consulting firms should strive toeducate and inspiretheir prospects, and do so on a regular basis.

Because guess what, the moment one consultancy stops producing thought leadership content, this void will get very quickly filled up by the content of another firm.

> Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep levels of expertise with their ability to identify patterns, to address very specific pain points, to predict trends, to offer practical advice.

Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep levels of expertise with their ability to identify patterns, to address very specific pain points, to predict trends, to offer practical advice.

## Thought leadership must be systematized to deliver business results

Alright, so I covered why thought leadership is a critical business development tool for consultancies and I talked about the type of content that senior executives are looking for. Now let’s discuss distribution channels.

The 2023 Grist study reveals that:

• 50%of senior executivesexpect to find thought leadership materials from advisory firms’ emails, newsletters, and websites.

• 52%arewilling to provide their email addressin exchange for valuable thought leadership.

Consultancies that do not utilize email marketing to the fullest are missing out on business opportunities. Plain and simple.

And I’m not talking about salesy “Look how awesome we are” emails. I’m talking about value-driven prospect-nurturing with high-end thought leadership content: articles, summaries from industry events, case studies, research, presentation slides, webinar summaries, etc.

Of course consultancies will not see the ROI of thought leadership if they do not organize it around a system that includes processes like:

• A calendar of posts to be created and their formats

• A distribution calendar and a system for each distribution channel

• A way to capture interest, turn them into subscribers, and nurture the relationship, continuously developing trust with the audience

• A way to measure the impact of each piece of content

Same goes for websites. I’m amazed to still be coming across dozens of consulting websites on a daily basis where the last blog post was 2 years ago or 6 months ago. The only info-capture form is the generic ‘contact us’ form. I wonder how far that gets them…

## In conclusion

Decision-makers are hungry for authentic, action-driven, inspiring thought leadership content.

They expect that from their prospective partners. They expect that from their current advisors. They use it as a critical metric to assess prospective partners. They are willing to leave their contact information behind to gain access to valuable thought leadership.

Really, how much more straightforward can it be?

Thought leadership is the ultimate way to showcase a consultancy’s expertise and build trust. It’s the ultimate way to build up the reputational footprint. This is not a fluke. It’s a trend that’s been in the making for years, and is unlikely to go away.

The longer consultancies resist, the further behind they will be left by those who understand the business development possibilities of thought leadership in the digital age.

# Your Consultancy’s Slowdown Isn't the Economy's Fault

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 09 March 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/your-consultancys-slowdown-isnt-the-economys-fault

---

Here is a non-exhaustive list of excuses I’ve heard so far this year about why consulting businesses are struggling.

• We had a slow start in 2023… because of reasons that are out of our control.

• Clients are postponing their decisions… so we can’t get our sales pipeline moving.

• The economy is tough right now… and nobody wants to spend money.

Newsflash: there has never been a perfect time for fast growth and business. This period of time just has more convenient excuses.But even at the economy's peak, I still heard excuses from otherwise very respectable consultancy founders for why their consultancies weren’t growing as expected. People are very good at finding new ways to see the problem instead of looking for a solution.Problems are inevitable. I started my consulting business in 2008, during the financial crisis. Everybody told me I was crazy. We did very well and were acquired by Deloitte in 2016. After my Deloitte exit in 2020, I launched my new consultancy, in the middle of the Corona lockdown! Difficult? Of course! But here we are, 3 years later, alive and kicking.You always have two options. You can keep making excuses and shifting the blame. Or accept responsibility, accept the reality of the matter, and start thinking about how to solve them.Hard as it may be to hear, there’s always a solution. There’s always a better or different way of doing things. Maybe there’s a new strategy you can pursue, or maybe you can just hang in there until things get better. But the key step is to stop thinking of new ways to see the problem.In short, if you want to grow your consultancy business, don’t finger-point. Though economy? Get over it.

## Love your problems

Let’s start by acknowledging that, yes, times are tougher than they were this time last year. But honestly, ask yourself: has your consulting business ever been truly 100% free of problems?The answer is almost certainly no. The truth is that even in better economic times, people find reasons to complain. The labor market was too tough, or clients had too many demands.The mind has a funny way of inventing problems if it can’t find any to work on.That’s because everything worthwhile in life is won by overcoming negative experiences. And that’s where we find meaning, both as individuals and as consulting leaders. So even when things are smooth, your mind looks for things to fixate on and worry about.Instead of seeing this period of economic uncertainty as something to complain about, start finding meaning in that struggle. Acknowledge that it's okay for things to suck sometimes, and that sucky feeling can actually bring purpose to you and your consulting business.

This is not only about finding solutions to your business problems but improving your quality of life as a consulting leader.

*Recommended reading:My Biggest Learnings in 10+ Years of Consulting Work*

## Don’t focus on the problems. Focus on the way forward

Focusing on your problems reduces your sense of control.“It’s not my fault.” “It’s the economy.” “I’m not to blame.”Focusing on the way forward empowers you.“How can I fix this?” “What can I do about this?” “How can we overcome this obstacle?”This mindset shift serves two purposes. First, it will help you find meaning in your consulting business. Things are hard, yes. But that doesn’t mean it’s OK for you to find excuses to complain.Second, your team is negatively impacted by your complaints. Your negativity and excuses don’t only affect you - they affect your employees, partners, and clients. And your family and friends. Get it together and help everyone look at things with more optimism.Look at those two dialogue lines above. Which one makes you feel most excited to work? Which one do you think is most inspiring to your team? The one where you complain, or the one where you take action?These problems are a way for you to find meaning in your work, power through struggles, and come out better.Don’t wish you had a problem-free life. Look for a way to build a life with good problems. This is a chance for you to reframe the bad economy as a way to adapt, change, and overcome obstacles and challenges.

## Pick your problems

Of course, don’t just accept your problems and suffer silently. There’s no value in suffering if you’re not getting something out of it.Problems are inevitable, but what they mean for your consultancy business is flexible. It all depends on how you react.What if I told you that you get to control what your problems mean to you, based on how you think about them? Like I said earlier, your mind will always find problems to fixate on. There’s no such thing as a problem-free business. It’s more important to think about how you respond to challenges.For example, yes, we’re in an economic downturn. Nobody knows what’s going to happen.You can let that take the blame for your poor performance. Lots of people are doing exactly that.Or you can understand that you are choosing to focus on solving this problem and commit to looking for ways to cope with it. Accept that there is a good response to the problem, and you can find meaning in trying to find it.You may want to feel like matters are out of your control, so you can blame someone else for your consultancy's struggles. But the truth is that you always control how you interpret what happens to you, as well as how you respond.It’s a mindset shift.

When you feel like you’re having problems forced upon you, against your will, you feel victimized and miserable. But when you actively choose your problems, you feel empowered.

*Recommended reading:Do You Need New Consulting Services to Fight the Recession?*

## Commit to the challenge of overcoming your problems

Accept responsibility for your problems. That’s the first step to solving them. They may not be your fault, but they’re still your responsibility.The next step is to commit to what you know is best.In a downturn, the worst thing you can do is stay stagnant and complain. The second-worst thingI’ve seen so many consultancy leaders dois flail around and add a bunch of new services to their roster.It feels like a good choice because at least your consultancy appeals to someone, and you’re gettingsomecash flow. However, firms that start offering a wide range of services to a wide range of prospects will only get poor-fit clients and substandard margins.This is especially important to keep in mind during economic downturns. Clients are under pressure and are looking for how to get the most profit from their investment, so they’ll be looking for consultancies to compete on price. If you offer a wide range of services, your firm can’t use focus and expertise as a selling point.This results in even lower profits since you can only compete by reducing your prices. That's what I always call 'the vicious loop to consulting hell'.Then, when the economy turns around, you’re in a worse position. Your ideal prospects will already have formed relationships with their go-to focused consultancies, and they won’t want to stop working with them since those firms will almost certainly have delivered real value during the downturn.Accept the problem. Embrace the positives of shifting your mindset about dealing with the problem. And commit to addressing the problem while also committing to your consultancy’s focus and expertise.

## It’s not the difficult economy, it’s you!

This may be a bit of a harsh wake-up call, but take it in the spirit it’s intended: there’s always a way out, a solution, a better way of doing things.You just have to stop looking outward at problems you can’t control, and start looking inwards to find your response to the problem - which you can control.The solution ultimately doesn’t matter. Maybe you need tothink about repositioning. Maybe it’s time tobuild an email listorrevamp your website. It’s not about what you do to fix the problem - it’s that you see this as a choice you’re making as you lead your consultancy.You are choosing to see this poor economy as an opportunity to take responsibility for your consultancy’s success.

# 4 Lessons Learned From A Consultancy Due Diligence

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 28 February 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/4-lessons-learned-from-a-consultancy-due-diligence

---

I recently assisted an investment firm with the due diligence of buying a consultancy.

Of course, the investors did all the usual due diligence stuff – evaluating the P&L, balance sheet, contracts, client analysis, assets, and liabilities - to name a few - of the consultancy. However, on top of that, they wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the following four dimensions:

• A special ‘reputation check’ (that’s why they reached out to me in the first place)

• An assessment of the co-owners’ alignment on the growth strategy of the consultancy

• An analysis of, what they called, the consultancy’s business infrastructure

• An assessment of the firm’s performance against consulting-specific KPIs

I derived some valuable insights from this project that I believe all consultancies should pay attention to – irrespective of whether they are looking to attract investors.

## 1. The reputation assessment

Based on 200+ conversations I’ve had with consultancy owners, one thing is clear: most vastly underestimate the impact of their reputation.Yet, in this instance, the investors were keen to understand if the consultancy owners had invested time and effort into building and maintaining their market reputation and had laid the foundation for a successful and long-lasting consulting firm.The investors assessed the following dimensions of the reputation of the consultancy owners:

• Published works and thought leadership (the owners' voice in the market)

• Owners’ social media presence and quality of activity (ability to attract new business)

• Media mentions and interviews

• Professional organizations and leadership positions

• Industry recognition, awards, reviews, comments

• Feedback from clients (I did five interviews with core clients)

While I can’t reveal the results of my assessment (it’s not the main point of this post anyways), this assessment process reinforced what I’ve been telling my clients and readers for years now: The market reputation of consultancy owners/leaders is a critical factor that significantly impacts the success and growth of their consulting firm.My main lesson from this exercise – and what I hope consulting leaders will take away from this section – is:A strong reputation in the market can establish consulting leaders as credible experts in their field, differentiate their firm from competitors, build brand recognition, and attract potential clients seeking their expertise.This special reputation assessment should be a wake-up call to all consulting leaders who think they can’t allocate the time to marketing their expertise through authority-driven, reputation-building activities. The reality: it’s imperative.Recommended reading:Consulting Leaders, Stop Outsourcing Your Thought Leadership Responsibility to Marketing!

## 2. Consultancy owners’ alignment on the growth agenda

This assessment dimension by the investors consisted of two parts:

• The alignment among the three co-owners (partners) on the growth agenda of the firm

• The alignment on the growth agenda within the core team of the firm

Here’s why they were interested in understanding internal alignment.In old-school models of business development in consulting, consulting owners are pretty much independent and self-sufficient in running their practice. In a network-first approach, they are much more relaxed about 'what to sell and what to accept'.But that’s not how high-growth consultancies operate in this day and age. Today, the digital-first go-to-market in consulting is more complex and requires disciplined internal alignment to remain competitive in crowded and noisy markets.The co-owner alignment assessment by the investors was all about the definition of the positioning, focus, and expertise, combined with a strong co-owner discipline to stick to that focus and translate that into (scalable) marketing and business development efforts, including building an educational/content strategy (see part 1).

> Poorly positioned consultancies will always struggle with a multitude of business development goals. They often get under mental pressure to start selling downstream availability (order takers instead of transformational experts) and usually begin overservicing the clients at a lower price.

Poorly positioned consultancies will always struggle with a multitude of business development goals. They often get under mental pressure to start selling downstream availability (order takers instead of transformational experts) and usually begin overservicing the clients at a lower price.

My main lesson from this exercise – and what I hope consulting leaders will take away from this section – is:Consulting owners must find a way to actively ensure internal alignment on the growth agenda to function as a well-organized, digital-first consultancy with a laser-sharp positioning in the market.If they don’t lead the internal alignment and/or are misaligned amongst the co-owners, performance inevitably suffers. And that’s what the investors were trying to understand.Recommended reading:Consultancies Must Rethink the Way Their Prospects Buy

## 3. An analysis of the consultancy’s business infrastructure

This dimension zooms out from the larger picture of the consulting firm’s market reputation and internal strategy alignment. It zooms in on the processes and mechanisms the consultancy has in place.Here, the investors were interested in understanding two things:

• The infrastructure to run the business. Questions the investors wanted answers to include:What is the software they use to operate the business?How well is the CRM organized and drives business development?How do they manage projects and people?How is the sales pipeline organized?What are the processes that nurture prospects and convert them into clients?

• The infrastructure to financially monitor and assess the business. What the investors wanted to know included:What are the processes through which financial performance is assessed?How are the targets set and communicated?What type of financial infrastructure allows owners to spot weaknesses, make projections?

• What is the software they use to operate the business?

• How well is the CRM organized and drives business development?

• How do they manage projects and people?

• How is the sales pipeline organized?

• What are the processes that nurture prospects and convert them into clients?

• What are the processes through which financial performance is assessed?

• How are the targets set and communicated?

• What type of financial infrastructure allows owners to spot weaknesses, make projections?

My main takeaway on this dimension is:Consultancies aiming for business growth can’t do so without having streamlined, organized systems and processes.The infrastructure behind the delivery of every client project must be documented and optimized every step of the way if firms want to maximize their profit margins.Recommended reading:Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy

## 4. Performance against consulting-specific KPIs

The fourth dimension – which most business people are familiar with – is the financials.Due diligence is generally about understanding the performance of the business. Here, we’re talking about the revenue trajectory, the P&L and balance sheet analysis, the budget, the sales forecast, the cash flow, ownership structure, IP, partnerships, liabilities, risks, contracts, assets, and so on.In this instance, the investors did their due diligence on all of these ‘typical’ financial aspects. Of course.However, on top of that, they executed a special assessment of these 10 consulting-specific KPIs:

• Client: Client list and revenue per client breakdown (including understanding recurring versus one-time revenue patterns and client retention);

• New business: Pipeline forecast, checking out the forecast disciple and quality (to understand the new project acquisition capacity) including number of leads, sales stage, average deal size, lead to opportunity conversion rate, and sales cycle duration;

• Utilization: past, current, and forecasted utilization to understand the consulting firm's efficiency in utilizing its resources (or any reasons for deliberate goal deviations);

• Revenue: per FTE (increasing when growing), driven mainly by project size, utilization, efficiency, and pricing;

• Cost of sales(decreasing when growing), driven by factors such as marketing & sales costs, competition, differentiation, reputation, visibility in the market, sales cycles, or client referrals;

• Pitch power: Win rates and win/loss analysis to understand the power and authority in the pitch;

• Risk: Client concentration to understand dependencies on too few (big) clients;

• Quality of work: Post-project client satisfaction;

• Stability: Consultant/team retention to understand how well the consultancy is managed;

• Margin: Gross margin per client, per project, per service, and total (expectations: north of 50%).

Consulting business, like any business, has its own set of rules and expectations. Profit margins are expected to be significantly higher than in many industries.Considering how much of a “people-first” industry it is, high employee turnover signals trouble to the firm's growth prospects. Given how reputation-dependent the consulting business is, referrals and return clients can make or break a firm.

My takeaway on this is:There are dozens, if not hundreds, of KPIs that can indicate how well or poorly their firms are performing. However, without a solid foundation for measuring the core activities, processes, and project organization, trying to fix the problems will be fruitless.Consulting firms that struggle with multiple performance indicators should take a step back and re-evaluate how they compete in the market.Recommended reading:Why You Should Reverse-Engineer Your Consulting Service Offering

## In conclusion

I loved the experience of working with the investors.I had a chance to take a step back and look at a consulting business from another perspective – that of an investor. It was an opportunity to look at a business in a much larger context and, at the same time, zoom in on dimensions many consultancies don’t even consider.Creating a reputational footprint is not just a solid business development strategy. It’s a factor that measures the health of a consulting business.Internal alignment is not just something that’s important for maximizing the ROI. It’s also an indicator of the growth potential of a firm.Business infrastructure and performance against industry-specific KPIs are not only there to ensure efficiency and measurability. They indicate whether a business is a well-oiled machine or employs a “gut feeling” strategy.An insightful experience, truly!

# Why Variation in Consulting Does Not Sell

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 14 February 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-variation-in-consulting-does-not-sell

---

I had a surprising call recently with a (very) tired consulting leader. To provide a bit of context, the chat was about the focus and expertise of his boutique consultancy. I challenged him on his firm’s (lack of) focus.An extract of the discussion…

Me: Do you admire other experts?Consulting Leader: Yes, I do. Many.Me: Why do you love other experts but you seem to glide on the surface of everything and get pushed around by everybody?CL: I understand why you challenge me, but I love the variety in consulting, Luk.Me: I’ve repeatedly seen that keeping all the options open will ultimately lead to shrinking returns and reduced quality of life. It’s like Facebook fatigue.CL: I always feel that fatigue.Me: Wow, really? Always?CL: Yes, always.I’ve had variations of this conversation on more than one occasion. In fact, I have such conversations constantly. With tired, drained and overstretched consulting leaders. They work long hours trying to figure out how to keep their firm afloat.One thing these firms have in common? They love the variation in the work of their firms. Though, I believe that it comes not as much from a place of love as a place of fear – the fear that reducing horizontal variation will result in fewer business opportunities.

> Most consultants tend to operate from a fear-based mindset, which causes them to take almost any work that pays and keeps their options open so they don't miss out on potential income or revenue. This reactive thinking actually strengthens the risk of remaining in mediocrity.

Most consultants tend to operate from a fear-based mindset, which causes them to take almost any work that pays and keeps their options open so they don't miss out on potential income or revenue. This reactive thinking actually strengthens the risk of remaining in mediocrity.

That’s what I’d like to discuss in this post – variation in consulting and why it stagnates, as opposed to boosts, business growth.

## Variation in consulting breeds open-options fatigue

All consulting leaders I’ve spoken to over the years want to be recognized as experts. Makes sense – that’s a matter of reputation, being known for the type of knowledge that very few other people or firms can compete against.They admire, maybe even envy other experts.Yet most consulting leaders keep all options open, reject focus, and never become experts. And neither do their consulting firms.How come? As mentioned at the beginning of this article, it stems from fear. They fear losing opportunities, and they are scared to make the jump to deep expertise. For many, it’s a matter of ego. Their ego tells them not to narrow because they believe they can crush everything.So, in their heads, they are stuck. That’s terribly tiring. I’ve been there. With burnout as a result. Heck.I call it the open-options fatigue – being tired of accepting all sorts of work yet refusing to narrow down the focus, with the end result of business growth either being too slow or not present at all. It’s being frustrated by the day-to-day pressure of bidding for new projects and trying to figure out how to deliver on them. It’s being stuck in the execution/implementation work, most likely at lower fees.

> I deeply enjoyed missing out for almost a decade. I said no to everything outside my focus because those non-ideal clients would eat my precious time. Too many consultants enjoy the variety at the expense of the craft. And it burns them out in the long run.

## Variation in consulting is exciting only in the beginning

Variation is exciting at first. I get that. But to be honest, it’s wearing off over time. Then, fatigue hits the road. The excitement of new projects, new types of clients, and acquiring new skills eventually loses ground to the frustration and stress of not having a reliable pipeline of work.Why does that business growth stall? Because a superficial level of expertise doesn’t pay as much. Because it doesn’t encourage referrals and repeat business. Because firms that offer variation spread their marketing and business development efforts thin, targeting too wide of an audience. So many reasons.A narrow focus, on the other hand, is maybe boring at first but becomes more exciting over time.People start inviting the expert – the industry leader who knows (almost) everything, has the most compelling data, can spot intriguing patterns, explain fascinating solutions, gets admired for thought-provoking ideas, and doesn’t need to sell or convince.These experts tend to lead their consulting firms in much the same way – encouraging continuous learning to deepen the knowledge and adamantly saying no to irrelevant, non-fit opportunities.The more such true experts stay the course of deepening their knowledge, the more opportunities they see open up to them. This is exciting and rewarding. And, of course, the more unique and relevant one’s knowledge is, the higher the fees, the fewer sleepless nights and fatigue.

## Specialization drives consulting efficiency and decreases fatigue

Repetition leads to efficiency. It’s as simple as that. The more you practice a skill, the easier and faster the process gets.

> If you can learn to focus and embrace repetition in your projects, you'll be well on your way to learning the deeper patterns, challenges, risks, and improvement methodologies that 99% of your competition will never know because they weren’t willing to put in the work and the narrow focus.

If you can learn to focus and embrace repetition in your projects, you'll be well on your way to learning the deeper patterns, challenges, risks, and improvement methodologies that 99% of your competition will never know because they weren’t willing to put in the work and the narrow focus.

Here are some of the many reasons why repetition and specialization in a consulting firm pays off:

• By narrowing down the focus, a consulting firm engages in repetitive processes that it can optimize and perfect over time, developing own specialized tools and methodologies. This enables the firm to leverage technology and automation to further streamline its processes and improve efficiency.

• The deeper the level of expertise, the more clear it becomes how to solve foundational problems for clients. It also means that this consultancy is able to offer more effective and efficient solutions.

• Consultancies that build their work on deep expertise and repetition are perfectly positioned to leverage their previous experiences and lessons learned along the way. As I always say: focus reduces variability of outcomes. And that’s a huge competitive differentiation driver. Clients are looking for outcome certainty and the better you can plan/predict, the stronger the pitch and the business case.

• The stronger the focus, the easier it is to develop vertical service extensions. As opposed to creating entirely new services (meaning having to pitch a new audience and lacking sufficient depth to compete against firms specialized in these fields), consultancies with deep expertise can develop new and deeper components of already existing consulting services. Examples of vertical services: a discovery service, retainer-based implementation advisory support, supporting clients in capability building, etc.

• Marketing and business development efforts deliver significantly higher ROI because they are targeted. They don’t try to appeal to a wide audience. Every piece of marketing collateral, every business pitch, every communication with a prospect is aligned with the business strategy of delivering high-value services to a niche audience.

• Repetition and deep expertise enable firms to set up efficient knowledge transfer procedures. Whether it comes to internal recruiting and bringing new consultants up to the level of expertise that’s expected or helping clients build an in-house team, firms with deep expertise can transfer knowledge in a more organized and effective manner.

• Deep expertise leads to happier clients and stronger referral work. When a consulting firm is able to provide its clients with massive value this client is more likely to return and to recommend the consultancy to the network.

## Specialization is the utmost variation

When I talk to real experts in consulting – consulting leaders who have gone deep in their focus and specialization – they no longer feel the pressure of choosing between variation in the work or specialization. Specialization, they keep telling me, is their utmost variation. Yes.Specialists are on a continuous learning journey – new approaches to old problems, the impact of upcoming trends on the pain points of their clients, new tools and software that make processes even more efficient, and so on.

> In working with consultancies week after week, I am realizing more and more that the extraordinary success of some of those consultancies is directly determined by how narrow they were able to make their focus.

In working with consultancies week after week, I am realizing more and more that the extraordinary success of some of those consultancies is directly determined by how narrow they were able to make their focus.

The more consulting leaders zoom in on a problem and study it inside-out, the more they are able to place it in a larger context and identify patterns, predict outcomes, and achieve measurable results. That’s the type of variation that doesn’t hinder business growth. Quite the opposite. It allows consulting leaders to grow: grow their business, recognition for expertise, fees, and appeal to the target audience.

## In conclusion

Consulting leaders often believe they will miss out on the next big opportunity if they narrow their focus and deepen their expertise.But they really miss out on the joy of being an expert. And getting recognized for it. Getting invited consistently as a result. They miss out on the opportunity to cut inefficiencies from their processes, to increase revenue-per-project, and to deliver superior value to clients.And ultimately, many consulting leaders, sooner or later, will get exhausted from the lack of depth in their consulting approach, of taking a shallow approach to all things expertise.Expertise is a superpower. And it's never exhausting.

# My Biggest Learnings in 10+ Years of Consulting Work

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 31 January 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/my-biggest-learnings-in-10-years-of-consulting-work

---

The start of a new year. Time for reflection.

I usually take some time at the beginning of the year to look back not just at the year that passed but at my experiences as a whole and see what lessons I can derive.

Have there been any shifts in my perspectives, and if so, why? How did my more recent experiences affect my decades-old learnings?

It’s a process, a journey. My reflections don’t happen in just one sitting. I jot down my thoughts over a few weeks and then review and organize them.

In this overview, I’d like to share the ten main consulting lessons I’ve learned in the past years. Many are based on what I’ve come across during my project work with consultancies, while others are based on what consulting leaders have shared with me in the past few years.

## 1. Consultancies talk too much about themselves

Too many consultancies have a solid inside view (‘here’s what WE do’) instead of a client-centric view (‘here’s what can be achieved’) in all their assets – be it the website, the marketing collaterals, the follow-up emails to prospects, their pitch decks, or business meetings.

The ‘let's-tell-our-clients-how-great-we-are’ mode.

And that just doesn’t work. At least not nearly as well as the outside view of focusing on the target audience’s pain points, educating them, providing them with authoritative insights, and showcasing deep levels of understanding of how these pain points can be eliminated.

That’s why I persistently and loudly keep urging consultancies to shift their focus from themselves and their giant ‘We, we, we’ language to a client-centric language talking about:

• The real problems and pains of their prospects and clients

• The transformational impact that can be achieved

Why is it so important? Because buyers research at the problem level, not at the level of incomprehensible, jargon-filled, self-centered consulting language!

> "It's not about what you think you are but about what it does for the client."

"It's not about what you think you are but about what it does for the client."

## 2. Consulting leaders should learn to control their ego

I’m referring to the ego that makes consulting leaders believe that their teams can deliver outstanding results on every incoming request.

No. They can’t. Not at the level that delivers superior value. Not at the level that pays premium fees and outstanding profit.

So they keep taking on any project, even if it’s not within their immediate scope of expertise and coming from non-ideal clients. That’s terribly tiring. I’ve been there. With burnout as a result. Heck.

Ego is a perfectly normal thing in consulting. Consulting leaders and their teams have to have a healthy amount of confidence in their skills and expertise.

However, when it overflows into the 'Look how great we are, we can crush everything’, type of thinking, the ego becomes a problem. These egos cannot make the difference between distraction and depth.

> "When you say yes to almost everything for short-term gain, your yes is not credible. A prospect can smell that!"

"When you say yes to almost everything for short-term gain, your yes is not credible. A prospect can smell that!"

My recommendation is to get narrow! Focus and control the ego. Stay in your lane. Love the craft and repetition of work. Enjoy life like me.

## 3. There is too much (unhealthy) focus on revenue

Revenue, revenue, revenue. That has always been my #1 focus. We had aggressive growth targets, especially after the acquisition by Deloitte. And that’s fine. I love the consulting frontline.

However, step-by-step, in working with and talking to many consulting firms, I also learned that such an extreme revenue focus could be detrimental to a consulting firm for several reasons:

• It stimulates unhealthy short-term thinking

• It causes greedy behaviors

• It leads to accepting work outside of the narrow focus

• It suppresses the development of educational content

• It causes a toxic incentive mindset

• It dilutes a sharp positioning in the market

• It beams the consultancy into commodity projects in the pricing rat race

• It’s just terribly tiring.

While revenue is vital for the success and sustainability of any business, I learned that a sole focus on it could be detrimental to a consulting firm in the long run.

It's crucial for consulting firms to strike a balance between generating revenue and delivering high-quality work while also taking care of the team, building long-term relationships with clients, and becoming a master at educating the target audience.

Like it or not, consulting, revenue, and profit are a byproduct of a strong expertise reputation and its leaders' personal thought leadership visibility.

> "We must simply choose to take control, first by specializing and shifting the power back from the client toward us, and then we can begin to shape our future as consultants." (Blair Enns)

"We must simply choose to take control, first by specializing and shifting the power back from the client toward us, and then we can begin to shape our future as consultants." (Blair Enns)

## 4. Consulting firms produce content without demand

Because consultancies create content, it doesn’t mean they create demand for their expertise.

I see this all the time, great content efforts and checking the content marketing box. And unfortunately, it stops there.

I get it. When I embarked on the content-sharing journey, I was focused on writing pieces that fall more into the ‘opinion category.’

It was not exactly what you’d call thought leadership. It took me some time to learn how to share content that delivers unique value to my audience – the type that places trends into a larger context, the one that anticipates long-term challenges stemming from short-term pains, and the kind that helps my audience transform their vision.

> ​​"Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep levels of expertise with their ability to identify patterns, to address very specific pain points, to predict trends, to offer practical advice."

​​"Leading thinkers in consulting are fearless with their content. They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep levels of expertise with their ability to identify patterns, to address very specific pain points, to predict trends, to offer practical advice."

Here’s the thing. Creating content is not the same as creating demand.

Content (be it a blog article, a speaking engagement, a podcast, etc.) needs to be defined along these lines:

• Inspiration: demonstrating the transformational potential of getting rid of the prototypical client problems

• Education: explaining how the target audience can get rid of their prototypical problems

• Motivation: 1) showing the risk/cost of inaction, and 2) explaining the business case for investing (the ‘unique buyer reason’)

• Activation: making it easy to get started with the problem resolution (e.g., with a discovery approach)

Content produced by consultancies should encourage action. Encourage change. Explain the problem, explain the solution, and demonstrate the firm’s/consultant’s superior ability to solve the pain point and deliver strong results. That’s how firms will generate demand with their expertise-driven content.

The ultimate role that thought leadership plays? Inspiring and preparing clients for change.

## 5. Faster decoupling of effort and value leads to more robust business results

I learned that the most profitable consultancies achieved the highest possible degree of decoupling value delivery from the effort.

For them, there’s no direct relationship between revenue growth and headcount increase. But to get there it requires disciplined execution and saying no to all non-ideal work.

Increasing headcount all the time - apart from direct hiring/training costs - substantially reduces:

• Internal expertise transfer

• Team stability & cohesion

• Project efficiency & utilization

• Speed of delivery

• Client satisfaction (clients want experienced consultants)

This is why so many consultancies struggle to grow (especially given the current labor market challenges) and to become highly profitable (because they cannot decouple value delivery from effort).

The ability to decouple value delivery and effort (=headcount) is an outcome of the well-positioned, narrowly focused consultancy.

If a consultancy can grow revenue without linearly adding hours, it can grow very profitably.

And the best way to achieve that is by:

• Narrowing positioning of the consulting business

• Developing deep, high-in-demand, focused expertise

• Repeating similar projects to minimize process and outcome variability.

The ultimate view: repetition of similar projects is the path to decoupling effort and profit.

And that’s why firms need a narrow positioning. Achieving a laser-sharp, differentiating positioning as a consultancy isn’t easy and can feel terrifying. Positioning your service is deciding what your service is, for who it is, what problem(s) you solve, and what specific impact you can have.

> "Apparently, in the consultant’s mind, it seems ‘safer’ to be just like everyone else. Let me challenge you with this logic: if your consultancy resembles all other consultancies, it is more likely to fail. If you really want the ‘safest’ option, just go get a job."

"Apparently, in the consultant’s mind, it seems ‘safer’ to be just like everyone else. Let me challenge you with this logic: if your consultancy resembles all other consultancies, it is more likely to fail. If you really want the ‘safest’ option, just go get a job."

## 6. Educating the target audience is a priority

Educating the target audience difficult? Too much work? No time to do it?

Consultancy leaders/owners who feel this way must have got it wrong. Educating the target audience IS the work!

If educating the target audience is seen as ‘on top of all the other work’, it’ll never work. Indeed, one of my biggest learnings is combining daily work with sharing leading thoughts about that work. This integration is critical and a vital job of a consulting leader.

It all boils down to the leaders' belief that educating their audience will be critical to future success. Maybe it’s even the #1 success criterion. That’s at least the opinion ofthis successful consulting leader, who writes about his experiences every morning.

That’s why I keep spreading that mission, explaining the ideal approach, and hoping my consulting clients will make the U-turn.

> "All major businesses in all major industries are suffering from all-time complexity in combination with a critical lack of the required internal expertise. We are living in times of golden opportunities in consulting for those who know how to take advantage of it."

"All major businesses in all major industries are suffering from all-time complexity in combination with a critical lack of the required internal expertise. We are living in times of golden opportunities in consulting for those who know how to take advantage of it."

Unfortunately, there’s not much I can do if the belief is not there. Clients often hit me with their utilization stories. In that case, I always think: they don’t get it. But I know it’s tough.

When we got acquired by Deloitte, I immediately asked for a utilization reduction to enable the educational component. It got accepted because of the belief of the leader. It was easy to convince.

Here's how I feel: if everything goes well in a consultancy, nobody seems to care about educating the target audience, which is shortsighted. If things are not going well, it's almost impossible to convince them about a thought leadership approach because it takes time and doesn't deliver short-term improvement, which is also shortsighted.

I learned that it is one of the most challenging conundrums in consulting.

*Recommended reading:Consultancies Will Always Have a Time Problem Until They Do This*

## 7. Consultancies must embrace the disciplined validation of new value propositions

Most consultancies always create services ‘out of the blue’ without doing the critical validation work. I observe this, especially when firms anticipate a challenging economic climate. They add a bunch of new services to capture the interest of a wider audience.

However, this rush to diversify is why so many (new) services have yet to get traction.

Value proposition design:I learned everything about value proposition design: how to create specific approaches for a particular audience with distinct pain points. Most consultancy firms have no clue, sorry to say. They deliver a project and start another service with it, believing they have a great value proposition. Nope.

Client validation:I learned how to validate service offerings with prospects and clients. Launching new approaches, methodologies, and value propositions are at risk of failure without proper target audience validation. I’ve always found (validation) one of the most challenging aspects of successful service offering design (and business development success).

Understanding client pain points or unmet needs is a complex (research) task. Why?

• Clients have needs they don’t even know they have

• Clients don’t always know what they suffer from until they are explained or shown how their work can be improved.

• Client needs change often over time.

• Clients struggle to articulate their pains or needs

A new service? I urge consultancies not to set themselves up for failure by launching serviceswithout proper client validation.

Here’s what consultancies can learn from the startup world, where a new product or service development has become sort of a science:

• Doing market research

• Gathering client feedback

• Carrying out pilot testing

• Nail down short iterations to quickly adjust

• Ensure thorough cost-benefit analysis

• And adjust again before launching.

> "Most consulting firms keep adding new services because they believe that more services will lead to more opportunities and revenue. Unfortunately, more services mean more competition, more price erosion, smaller margins, thinner expertise, poorer thought leadership, less time to get visible, more hiring challenges, more training hours, more client gatekeepers to deal with, more objections from more stakeholders, and probably 100 more fallouts. Think twice."

## 8. Hitting the project wall massively stalls growth

Consulting work can be categorized mainly into upstream and downstream work.

Downstream work is low-altitude. It centers primarily around day-to-day execution and/or implementation work, which has a relatively low impact on the client's real pains.

Upstream work, on the other hand, is high-altitude. It's all about high-level strategic and/or diagnostic advisory. This type of work has a significant impact on the client's real pains.

Switching to an upstream ‘client transformation’ consulting approach is THE #1 pillar of success in consulting – the type of success where consultants are in control of their time, when consulting leaders comfortably and organically grow the business, when firms pick which projects they work on (and say NO to any project outside of their focus zone), where business development is inbound, pricing is above-market, and margins significantly higher than average.

Unfortunately, too many consultancies never get over ‘the project wall’. They wish to become strategic advisors but get stuck in lower-value project work (or even ‘body shopping’).

> Most consultants charge for (downstream) implementation work and do the upfront discovery and problem diagnosis for free. As an authority in your expertise domain, however, you charge premium rates for (upstream) upfront discovery, problem diagnosis, and roadmapping, and you stay away from doing the (downstream) implementation work yourself.

Most consultants charge for (downstream) implementation work and do the upfront discovery and problem diagnosis for free. As an authority in your expertise domain, however, you charge premium rates for (upstream) upfront discovery, problem diagnosis, and roadmapping, and you stay away from doing the (downstream) implementation work yourself.

The three ways to break through the project wall I’ve been using myself in consulting:

• Developing a discovery audit:It helps companies understand their improvement opportunities in a specific (strategic) domain, e.g., supply chain inventory improvements, cyber security risk analysis, data analysis feasibility study, etc. It’s a Trojan Horse to move upstream with consulting work.

• Developing a ‘building the function’ value proposition:Most consulting firms don’t have a specific value proposition to help organizations ‘build the function’ (or improve, which can also be included in the discovery audit). And they are missing out on high-level upstream work. I did much work for our clients to help them establish the people analytics function (during my past iNostix/Deloitte era): defining the roles & responsibilities, preparing the job descriptions for new hires, helping them with the first analytical pilots and implementation, setting up collaboration with other functional areas (e.g., the data CoE), etc.

• Developing vertical service extensions:This approach refers to developing new and deeper components of already existing consulting services instead ofcreating entirely new services. By moving away from order-taker requests (in front of the wall) and developing new and deeper components of existing services, consulting firms can move upstream, differentiate themselves from competitors, command higher prices and margins, position themselves as trusted advisors to their clients, and improve client retention.

In conclusion:To get over the project wall, it's crucial for consulting firms to have a strategic plan in place to move upstream and develop new and deeper components of their existing services (e.g., discovery, functional building, vertical extension).

By focusing on providing value-added services, consultancies can improve their margins, increase revenue potential, and strengthen their relationships with their clients.

## 9. Early prospect disqualification is a must

You probably are thinking now: what is he talking about? Is this a real learning worth mentioning it? Yes, it is one of my biggest learnings in a decade of consulting work: early disqualification. Why?

In my early years, I failed to disqualify prospects early on at the start of the contact. I spent too much time talking to prospects whose projects were misfits. I should have been stricter, more disciplined, and definitely faster in disqualification. Why? Because failing to do so is a drain of resources – time, energy, and, ultimately, money.

And this is the most significant learning of all: it’s the litmus test for the positioning of a consultancy. The better and sharper the positioning, the easier it is to disqualify quickly. Or, misfit clients don’t even show up because they’ve understood the consultancy’s expertise definition.

Hence my reversed thinking: if consultancies struggle with early disqualification, something must be wrong with the positioning: definition of the target audience, with a specific problem(s), a clear value proposition, and supported by a compelling educational program.

Early, thorough, and disciplined (dis)qualification is part of a consultancy’s success. I keep repeating this all the time.

Ordinary consultancies are asked to send a quote, and they say yes to almost anything to protect short-term revenue. Again, I get that. Unfortunately, having to sell all the time is a toxic ticket to the pricing rat race and substandard profitability.

High-in-demand, go-to expert consultancies get invited to solve a problem and say no a lot to protect time and focus, maintain low variability in project process and outcomes, safeguard their expert reputation, and secure premium pricing and profit.

Their success is a side effect of the meticulous qualification of prospects (and positioning clarity, of course).

> "Consultancies cannot build and grow a reputational footprint in a consulting market without a clear decision about who they are, what they can achieve, and for whom they have unparalleled problem resolutions."

"Consultancies cannot build and grow a reputational footprint in a consulting market without a clear decision about who they are, what they can achieve, and for whom they have unparalleled problem resolutions."

## 10. The reputation of the consultancy owners induces profit

Building and growing my market reputation has always been a big focus of mine. I am deeply convinced that the reputation of owners or leaders in consulting can drive profitability.

A strong reputation and personal brand attract clients and boost trust, while a weak reputation can deter business. The owners' market reputation is crucial to the success and profitability of a consulting firm.

I recently assisted an investor with the due diligence of buying a consultancy, and I was surprised by their detailed attention to the market reputation of the consultancy owners.

Of course, the investors did the usual due diligence work, but on top, they ran a ‘special reputation check’, and that’s why I got involved.

Most consultancy owners need to pay more attention to the impact of their reputation. The investors were keen to understand if the consultancy owners had invested time and effort into building and maintaining their market reputation and had laid the foundation for a successful and long-lasting consulting firm.

Here’s what they asked me to assess:

• Published works and thought leadership (the owners' voice in the market)

• Owners’ social media presence and quality of activity (ability to attract new business)

• Media mentions and interviews

• Professional organizations and leadership positions

• Industry recognition and awards

• Reviews, comments, google relevance of/about the owners

• Feedback from clients (I did 5 interviews with core clients)

The investment project leader explained to me loud and clear:

"Beware of consultancy owners with poor reputation and visibility in their core markets! This usually means you'll face sky-high client acquisition costs, a snail's pace when it comes to closing contracts, a pitiful proposal win rate, and substandard client retention - all of which translates directly into slim margins."

And he closed our chat by saying:

“A poor reputation can also make it difficult for a consulting firm to attract top talent, which will limit the firm's ability to provide high-quality services and maintain a competitive edge”.

Wow. Did you ever think of that?

The market reputation of consultancy owners/leaders is a critical factor that significantly impacts the success and growth of their consulting firm. Proven by the special attention it got from these investors.

A strong reputation in the market can establish the leaders as credible experts in their field, differentiate their firm from competitors, build brand recognition, and easily attract potential clients seeking their expertise. Or attract investors.

A wake-up call?

## In summary

As I reflect on my learnings over the last decade, I realize how much time and energy I could’ve saved early on in my consulting career had I practiced what I preached from the very start. Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20. Fortunately, arriving at these lessons allowed me to build multiple successful consulting businesses.

That’s why I’m adamant about sharing my learnings with others – with fellow consultants and consulting leaders. Not every success has to come from years of personal experience and mistakes. Some strategies have proven to deliver strong results in a sustainable, scalable way.

This is why reflecting on my learnings and re-evaluating them is essential for me – using them to help my consulting readers save valuable time and energy.

# 10 Consulting Trends: 2023 Edition

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 23 January 2023
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/10-consulting-trends-for-2023

---

A new year gives consultancies an excellent opportunity to review their client work over the past year and brainstorm how to adjust their business development strategy to grow moving forward.

I have spoken to 100+ consulting leaders in 2022. I also hosted webinars, received countless emails with questions from individual consultants, read thought leadership content by consultancies, reviewed business plans of firms both small and large, and audited the positioning of 30+ consultancies and worked with those consulting firms to improve their positioning and business development in the market.

Here, I’m sharing the 10 most pronounced trends that I’ve observed in my projects, research, and audits. I urge consulting leaders to pay close attention to these trends – they can make or break a consulting business.

A Consulting Trends Workshop for your consultancy?Would you like me to talk to your consultancy team, colleagues, or leaders about these trends and how to deal with them? I am conducting many workshops for consultancies to help them deal with these consulting industry trends. Booking inquiries viainfo@thevisibleauthority.com. Looking forward!

## 10 Consulting Trends Consultancies Should Be Ready For In 2023

#1. Business development in consulting is rooted in educating the target audience#2. Consultancies embracing digital new client generation will grow faster#3. Consultancies with weak positioning are less profitable#4. Buyers’ behavior, habits, and expectations are shifting#5. We have entered an era of deep specialization#6. Clients want trustworthy consultancies that can deliver quick wins and long-term results#7. Consulting leaders can no longer avoid actively participating in marketing#8. Consultancies neglecting former and existing clients will struggle with poor marketing and business development ROI#9. Legacy reputation and brand recognition will continue to fall in importance#10. Consultancies using self-centered language will lose opportunities to those using client-centric language

## Trend #1: Business development in consulting is rooted in educating the target audience

“Thought leadership” is used too often to label any piece of content produced by a company or its employees.

In fact, 71% of executivessay less than halfof the thought leadership content they consume provides any sort of valuable insight.

> Not all content is thought leadership. And not all thought leadership content generates the same ROI and business development results.

Not all content is thought leadership. And not all thought leadership content generates the same ROI and business development results.

So what do decision-makers look for in thought leadership content? It’s quite simple, really. They are looking for answers to questions that keep them up at night. According toresearch:

• 51% of executives look for fresh and forward-thinking qualities in thought leadership content.

• 47% are interested in action-oriented content that can help make more informed decisions.

Decision-makers are looking for evidence that the solution to a problem has worked – i.e., case studies. According toa study, this is the #1 most important criterion in B2B thought leadership. The depth of knowledge about the problem and how to solve it is #2.

As I explain inone of my articles, the way senior executives buy consulting services has changed. Above all else, they are looking for solutions that have proven to work, delivered by those with deep expertise.

The most powerful way for consultancies to communicate their capabilities to prospective clients is by consistently producing educational content that goes to the heart of the pain points of their target audience.

This content – in the form of blog articles, case studies, speaking engagements, webinars, podcasts, email campaigns, LinkedIn posts, etc. – should provide the kind of insights that only someone with deep expertise can uncover.

What’s more, this thought leadership content should inspire action. It should inspire the readers – the target audience – to change their pain-ridden status quo to reach new business horizons.

## Trend #2. Consultancies embracing digital new client generation will grow faster

Digital marketing in consulting will continue to grow in importance. It’s not just a trend. It’s the reality we all live in – as consumers and as B2B buyers.The sooner consultancies accept and embrace it, the sooner they can set up a digital footprint that delivers business results.I always remind consultancies of the 90-80 rule. Nine out of ten service buyers will actively do their own research on a consultancy and its consultants. Unfortunately, eight out of ten firms automatically get rejected because their digital footprint does not point to a desired level of expertise.

Thetop three methodsof finding consulting firms are:

• asking peers/colleagues for a recommendation;

• doing a general web search;

• listening to an expert speak on a topic.

And what does the general web search often start with? That’s right, with decision-makers googling their problem.

Consultancies that fail to produce relevant, authoritative, narrowly-focused content regularly will go unnoticed by Google’s algorithm.

And, in this day and age, if a business does not show up on Page 1 of Google (or, at the bare minimum, on the first 2-3 pages), it may as well not exist.95% of all trafficis cannibalized by pages displayed on Page 1 of the search engine.

It’s no wonder that keyword research and search engine optimization isthe second most important tacticutilized by high-growth consultancies.

Consultancies that neglect digital marketing? Well, they will never get out of the vicious downward spiral, always trying to play catch-up, desperately offering discounts, cold-calling prospects, and struggling to build a reliable pipeline of work.

Whether it’s service buyers doing their own search, coming across relevant consultancies, hearing recommendations from peers/colleagues, and then looking up that firm or consultant on Google and LinkedIn, it all leads to the same road – the digital space.

Consultancies must be acutely aware of what their digital presence – or lack thereof – tells their target audience: does it help prospects understand the depth and relevance of the firm’s expertise and/or does it encourage prospects to continue reading/listening/watching the advice or makes them close the tab in 5 seconds?

If consulting leaders want to be serious about growing their consulting business and starting to attract ideal clients in a more consistent and predictable way, they will have to get comfortable with digital marketing and business development. We live in a new digital-first consulting world (versus network-first). And this will not change anymore.

## Trend #3. Consultancies with weak positioning are less profitable

In 2022, clients wereoffered discounts by consultanciesin 80% of the cases. In 2019, that number was 66%. Clearly, too many consultancies struggle with their positioning and business development efforts.

The thing about discounts is that this practice devalues a consulting firm's expertise and trains prospects and former clients to expect it.

What do consultancies that offer discounts have in common? Weak positioning.

Positioning is a company's place within a marketplace. It’s a statement, the way it is perceived on the market, and the parameters the consultancy sets for their own work and engagement with clients.

If it’s weak, there is a disconnect between what the consultancy does, how it markets the services, and to whom it markets these services. Competition is fierce. Consultancies that can’t differentiate themselves with laser-sharp positioning have no choice but to compete on pricing.

On the other hand, strong positioning makes it instantly clear to prospects whether a consultancy is a good fit for their needs.

*Recommended reading:A Consultancy's Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying Decision*

​​Inone of my articles, I highlight 14 symptoms of poor positioning. They include things like:

• Struggling with getting constant client objections

• Taking on any incoming project just to fill up the pipeline

• Constantly dealing with lower-level management and requiring tons of approvals before taking any step in a client project

• Failing to provide transformational case studiesAnd many more

What is the secret of highly successful consultancies? It’s their unwavering commitment to their strong positioning. They know exactly what they do well, who will benefit from their services, and how to show their expertise and the ability to deliver results.

These consultancies relentlessly say no to all irrelevant opportunities. They are extremely protective of their time. They decrease their costs by increasing efficiency, which comes from repetition, which comes from a narrow focus, which comes from laser-sharp positioning.

When it comes to profitability, there are many stats flying around. For example, according tothis one, the average annual gross margin for consulting firms in 2022 was 53.6%. In my experience, that number is between 60% and 80% for highly successful and well-positioned consultancies!

This level of success can’t be achieved by consultancies that have internal and external misalignment – which is what inevitably comes out of weak positioning, and it often originates (and gets worse over time) from internal vision differences amongst the owners or partners

Marketing and sales are not communicating the same message as consulting leaders and individual consultants. Marketing or business development campaigns are not aligned with thought leadership pieces. Clients have no idea how to best recommend a firm.

A boat where every person paddles in a different direction doesn’t stand a chance of outperforming one where the force of every team member is directed towards a unified goal.

And I’ve seen it time and time again, internal positioning misalignment translates into substandard profitability.

## Trend #4. Buyers’ behavior, habits, and expectations are shifting

Decision-makers who purchase consulting services are increasingly resembling B2C buyers.

They google questions related to their pain points, consume content to better understand improvement opportunities, and read up on the “social proof” (review in B2C, case studies in B2B). They look for targeted solutions to very specific problems. They expect to be able to find all the necessary information online.

63% of buyers report that the pandemic had increased the number of people involved in an average purchasing decision.

As mentioned in the first trend here, they look to their peers and colleagues for recommendations. They conduct independent online research. They listen to expert presentations or podcasts and draw conclusions on a consulting firm's level of expertise and overall trustworthiness.

Consultancies that fail to adapt to this shift in buyers’ behavior and expectations will see constantly decreasing returns on their marketing and business development investments. Here are just a few examples:

• A firm that disseminates its educational pain-resolution-driven and action-inspiring content on LinkedIn is more likely to be noticed by a larger number of stakeholders in the prospect's company than one that mindlessly cold-calls and emails said prospects.

• A firm that writes case studies highlighting the results and how these results were achieved will build more trust with the audience than one that only boasts about numbers.

• A firm that shows up on the first page of Google for relevant keywords will generate significantly more leads than one that is buried on Page 10.

It is crucial that consultancies pay attention to these evolving habits of their target audience. This understanding will allow them to build the right exposure and maximize it on the right channels.

## Trend #5. We have entered an era of deep specialization

All major businesses in all major industries are suffering from all-time complexity in combination with a critical lack of the required internal expertise and no immediate availability of these experts on the distressed labor market.

The business challenges have never been so strenuous (to name a few):

• Digital disruption threats

• Post-Covid supply chain muddle

• Cyber security headaches

• Climate change imperatives

• Hybride working challenges

• Rising energy costs and war concerns

• E-Mobility and electrification dilemmas

• Post-Covid employee turnover

• Fierce labor market shortages

• Inflation and recession concerns

Growth setbacks have started to surface almost everywhere due to considerable expertise gaps without a short-term solution perspective due to labor market shortages.

All these tormented businesses are looking for external expertise. The stress is huge, the pains are fierce. Businesses are desperate and often have no choice but to turn to specialized consultancies for support.

The hardships of the last 2-3 years have highlighted buyers’ emphasis on fast and predictable outcomes of working with a consultancy. They have very specific problems they want urgent help with. And it typically calls for deep expertise.

Recent researchconcluded the importance of industry knowledge and deep subject matter expertise (the 2 most important selection criteria, says this research) rose by 7% between 2020 and 2022. The importance of relevant experience and past performance rose by 4% in the same time period.

It makes sense, too. As consumers, that’s exactly how we behave. More often than not, if we need to have a washing machine fixed, we go to a repairman specializing in washing machines, not a handyman. If we have dental pain, we go to a dentist, not a GP. If we struggle with money management, we go to a financial advisor, not a life coach. We want to put our time and money towards stronger, more guaranteed results.

B2B buyers expect the same. 60% of organizations reportlacking specific specialist skills. That means they will often fill in these skill gaps by going to consulting firms. Specialist consultancies with strong positioning and reputational footprint will be the first in line for these projects.

Consultancies need to fully grasp all the details, the background, context, relationships, characteristics, frequency, volume, the typical stakeholders involved, etc., of the critical pains of the target audience (in its narrow domain expertise).

For those who cover multiple expertise areas (keeping the options open out of fear of losing income), that’s totally impossible to accomplish, and prospects will ‘smell’ this quickly.

Specialist consulting firms can achieve stronger financial success and here’s why:

• Specialization is the path to the repetition of similar projects;

• Repetition of similar projects is the path to deeper expertise (and more project efficiency and little variability in outcomes);

• Deeper expertise is the path to irresistible value for the client;

• Irresistible value is the path to premium pricing;

• Premium pricing is the path to sustainable profit;

In the end, this sustainable profit builds the self-confidence and the belief of the consultancy to protect the narrow focus (read specialization) and provides the funding for continuous investment in the development of inspirational content and education (seetrend #1).

> When I talk to real, profound experts in consulting - consultants who have gone deep in their focus and expertise - they no longer feel the pressure of choosing between variation in the work or depth. Depth, they keep telling me, is their utmost variation.

When I talk to real, profound experts in consulting - consultants who have gone deep in their focus and expertise - they no longer feel the pressure of choosing between variation in the work or depth. Depth, they keep telling me, is their utmost variation.

Better profit is the ‘side-effect’ of specialization. While simple in principle, it requires strong discipline, deep commitment, and the ability to focus single-mindedly on a narrow area daily.

## Trend #6. Clients want trustworthy consultancies that can deliver quick wins and long-term results

According to a study by Grist, 19% of executives are now zeroed in on the next 3 months, and 38% have their sights on the 3-12 month period.

This shorter time horizon has inevitably led to a shift to shorter selection lead time for new consulting companies (less patience) in combination with a much stronger focus on selecting visible experts with well-established social proof in their market or industry.

Clients are looking for consulting firms they can trust. They want to work with firms that can help them create an impact on the bottom line. They are looking for a fire-proof way to (internally) justify the investment into consulting services.

> Buyers trust consultancies that clearly display expertise and the ability to achieve meaningful and proven results before they even engage with these firms.

Buyers trust consultancies that clearly display expertise and the ability to achieve meaningful and proven results before they even engage with these firms.

Buyers don’t want to be sold. They don’t want to read or receive sales materials that say generic, pompous things like “We supercharge our clients to reach maximum performance levels.”

They want consultancies that understand the buyers' issues on a deep level. The ones that can place these problems in a larger context. The ones that have successfully implemented transformative projects for similar clients in the past and are freely sharing those success stories (including the ‘how’) in their communication.

• Buyers want to see immediate results.Tough economic times increase the scrutiny and accountability for every investment. Clients are under tremendous pressure to justify their spending on consulting services almost instantly. Of course, I’m not talking about results over a few days. But it is important for consulting firms to be able to show the difference their services make within a few weeks or months.

• Buyers want to be set up for long-term success.They don’t want services that put duct tape on a pipe that needs replacing. When they hire consultancies, even for short-term projects, they want a permanent – or at least long-term – improvement to their status quo.

AsSource puts it,“This drive for faster, better consulting solutions is leading clients to classify consulting firms differently, a trend we believe will continue into 2023”.

That’s why it’s more important than ever that consultancies keep their ideal clients’ and these clients’ needs in mind in all their external messaging.

In 2023, consultancies that want to match their messaging to the expectations of prospects will replace websites that go on and on about how amazing their expertise is with ones that talk about the specific pain points they help address and how they do it.

It’s time for consultancies to stop with the useless bragging and embrace more educational, inspiring content.

## Trend #7. Consulting leaders can no longer avoid actively participating in marketing

Consulting leaders must increase their engagement in marketing and business development activities.

81% of buyerswant provocative insightsthat challenge their assumptions rather than validate their current thinking. Marketers simply can’t deliver that. They do not have the same level of expertise in the field as consulting leaders and individual consultants in a firm. It’s not their job to have the same depth of expertise.

A consulting firm can hire the most brilliant marketers or content writers who know SEO best practices, are fluent in various marketing automation technologies, and can efficiently manage social media accounts.

But, if consulting leaders are not driving marketing efforts by providing them with their leading thinking, the marketers are only getting set up to fail.

*Recommended reading:Consulting Leaders, Stop Outsourcing Your Thought Leadership Responsibility to Marketing!*

The new archetype consulting firm, openly sharing its expertise, doesn’t worry about making money but about educating its target audience to help them solve their problems (see also Trend #1). The result of not worrying about money is that they will make more money in the end.

Consulting leaders will need to step up in 2023 and get in the habit of sharing their leading thinking and the expertise of the firms/practice in a consistent manner.

They will need to work with the marketing teams on developing content calendars and promotional channels. They will need to lead by example, encouraging their team members to share their collective expertise in a way that educates the audience and inspires them to take action.

*Recommended reading:Shaping Your Consultancy’s Thought Leadership To Accelerate Growth*

I noticed that most consulting leaders dislike social media. Social media are an incredible medium to build trust in the consultancy’s expertise.

Consulting leaders tell me: "I can’t do that, I don’t have the time, I don’t know what to write about."

You know what? It’s like driving a car and not fueling it up because you don’t have time or you don’t like doing it. Your car will get stuck. Right?

If consulting leaders are not investing time and energy in developing and sharing educational content on social media or other distribution channels, they will soon be outperformed by their social media-savvy competitors.

The best consulting leaders from the new school consulting firms will be multi-platform educators, dramatically raising the awareness of the transformational improvement opportunities of the critical pain points of their target audience.

Marketing or external content writers are maybe great at rephrasing already accepted opinions but awful at spotting non-obvious insights that create radically different thinking. That’s the role of the consulting leader.

## Trend #8. Consultancies neglecting former and existing clients will struggle with poor marketing and business development ROI

Only 12% of consulting firmshave a fully implemented sales referral strategy, with those that do grow much quicker as a result.

How is that even possible? Aren’t we all aware of the fact that it’s significantly more expensive to recruit a new client than to keep a new one?

It costs5x as muchto attract a new customer than to keep an existing one. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%. The probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20%.

The fact that retaining clients and going after referenceable work is not a #1 business development priority for consultancies is mind-boggling.

“But I just don’t have time! Between lead gen and actually doing my job, when could I develop a nurture strategy?” That’s a typical response of consulting leaders.

Client retention and staying on top of past clients’ minds is not complicated. Consultancies must give former and current clients the chance to hear from them regularly by unlocking their inner teacher and never stopping giving valuable lessons.

Consulting firms should start producing educational content and then sharing it with their past and current clients – newsletters, individual emails, social media posts, etc.

*Recommended reading:Why Do So Many Consultancies Neglect Former and Existing Clients? That’s Where the Money Is!*

So much can be achieved in business development by keeping former and existing clients in the loop to nurture them.

An email list should be one of a consulting firm's most cherished marketing assets. This tool stood the test of time and generates the highest ROI of all marketing platforms.

However, the success of building and utilizing an email list varies from business to business. When consulting firms focus on quality and on sharing content that educates their audience, their email lists can generate superior results in the long run.

Quality should be in the thought leadership pieces consulting firms deliver to their contacts – authentic, with real insights, addressing key pain points of their target clients. These insights should be shared freely and regularly with former (and don’t forget former clients who changed jobs), existing, and future clients.

Consultants always wonder why I am talking about ‘nurturing existing clients’. The saying goes: they are already our clients, why should we nurture them? Well, it’s pretty easy: it’s good client management to structurally (not just between two project meetings) keep them in the loop of new findings, the latest research, new technology evolutions, recent case studies, etc. And, of course, it’s about possible upselling, cross-selling, or just plain retention management.

## Trend #9. Legacy reputation and brand recognition will continue to fall in importance

Many firms have been taking their visibility for granted. And they shouldn’t. Theperception of a highly visible firm fellfrom 23.1% in 2020 to 14.6% in 2022. And it will continue to fall.

As I highlighted inTrend #4, buyers’ behavior and expectations are shifting. They are less impressed by how recognizable a consultancy’s brand is and more by the results a firm can demonstrate it can achieve.

As highlighted inTrend #6, buyers also seek proof of the consultancy’s ability to deliver outcomes. Brand recognition can only go so far.

Add to that the client-hungry, digitally-savvy competitors in the form of boutique firms that pop up daily. The ones that generously share their knowledge. The ones that engage their target audience through thoughtful pieces full of actionable insights and recommendations.

Brand awareness remains essential and is a great marketing and business development support. However, brands don’t solve problems, and consulting firms' ability to rely on their legacy reputation and brand awareness to compete against these ruthless, expertise-led (versus brand-led) newcomers will only decrease with time.

Expertise-led (bottom-up) is how differentiation gets created in consulting. Brand-led (top-down) is how awareness for that differentiation gets strengthened or scaled.

## Trend #10. Consultancies using self-centered language will lose opportunities to those using client-centric language

To quote anHBR article, “Vendor websites can strongly influence the search. Buyers at the research stage want to see an informative, easily navigated website, and have little patience for sites that fall short.”

The buyers are impatient. They have no time (or desire) to spend more than a few minutes glancing through a consulting firm’s website or documentation.

And the sad reality is that most consultancies’ websites suck. Big time.

Consulting is a competitive, trust-based business. Consulting firms need to have darn good websites with a proper structure, unparalleled proof of expertise, and influential educational content.

And most of all, these websites should organically generate demand for the firms' (focused and publicly announced) expertise.

It shouldn’t be a big ‘We-we-we’ show. It should be laser-focused on the pain points of the target audience. And that applies to every piece of communication outside of the website – thought leadership pieces, LinkedIn posts, pitches to prospective clients, speaking engagements.

Every piece of content should use client-centric language.

Most consultancies make the big mistake of telling their prospects an inside-in story:

• what their unique services are

• how exceptional their experience is

• how many years of awesome experience they haveand on and on and on...

It’s all about bragging about their so-called unique expertise, unique service, unique blah blah blah.

Here are just a couple of the MANY examples from consultancies I came across this year (the inward blah blah always starts with ‘WE’):

• (big global consultancy) “We are unleashing the power of your workforce” (sounds magic, what does ‘unleashing the power’ mean?)

• (boutique consultancy) “We empower global teams to outperform in a sustainable business context” (what is empowering to outperform in a sustainable blah blah way?)

• (solo consultant) “We are experts in driving digital HR by empowering your people” (Why use ‘WE’ as a solo consultant? But OK, we don’t get it anyway)

I urge consultancies always remember that buyers do their research at the expertise and problem level, not at the level of this inward braggy language! The buyer never ever researches or asks industry peers, ‘do you know a consultancy that can help us to unleash the power of our workforce?’!

The simple fact is: It’s not what consultancies think it is but what it does to their client.

To get the attention of prospects browsing through dozens of websites and thought leadership pieces as they try to identify the right consultancy is to show a profound understanding of their pain points and the level of expertise needed to address them.

No one is interested in self-centered, self-promoting bragging.

*Recommended reading:Consultancies Can't Grow Their Business When Their Websites Suck*

## In Conclusion

2023 is full of possibilities. And yes, I say that while fully aware of the anxiety many consulting leaders are experiencing over the looming recession.But that’s exactly why consultancies should take the time to re-evaluate their current practices: their approach to business development, their positioning, the language they use to communicate with prospects, and so on.A recession shocks the system, which means it will open up new opportunities. Consultancies that can anticipate these opportunities, align their (narrow) positioning to changing client needs, and use education-driven content to communicate value and expertise, can expect to come out on top.

# 140+ Pieces of Advice I Shared with Consultancies on LinkedIn in 2022

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 22 January 2023

2022 was an insightful, productive year. I had a chance to restart traveling, having hosted workshops for clients in Europe and the US.

I spoke to hundreds of consultancies from firms, small and large. I developed new programs and offerings. As I documented all my learnings, I uncovered new patterns and insights – many summarized in the 2023 edition of the10 trends consultancies must be aware of.

# I Never Had To Sell, Persuade Or Negotiate To Grow My Consulting Business

I never had to sell, persuade or negotiate.That’s what I wrote shortly following my departure from Deloitte in 2020 after a 4-year period, post acquisition (2016).Throwback time.I got (and still get) this question all the time: is my continuous audience education work paying off?Well…it’s paying off big time. For more than a decade now. People keep asking me – often somewhat skeptically – if my hard content work has been paying off, has helped me to grow my consulting business in the past years.

I get those questions because becoming visible with valuable content is something most consultancies really struggle with. The truth though is that visibility is the only thing that is going to make a firm stand out in a crowded and very competitive consulting world.

The biggest blunder that consultancies can make is to think that somehow potential clients will find them. Nothing could be further from reality.

## Unlocking the inner teacher

It wasn’t always easy to produce valuable content. Not every swing was a hit. But it never felt like an uphill battle to me and sharing my expertise has enabled me to create opportunities that I would not have had otherwise.

Instead of developing short-lived content with the aim of telling potential clients how great we were (which would have been a darn uphill battle), I always focused on sharing deep experience and knowledge. The teacher in me kept asking:

• What did I learn in the project trenches about the biggest client pains that others could learn from?

• Which experiences did I acquire that could be valuable for others?

• What were the unique client stories (with successes and struggles) that could inspire others to pursue better outcomes?

Marketing in the consulting field is surprisingly easy! Consultancies simply need to share their unique stories and experiences in an authentic and passionate way and they will organically create a strong and loyal client base!

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I’ve always been surprised that by sharing my stories from the front line I was able to outperform the visibility of thousands of top consultants at Deloitte globally.

The more content I shared, the bigger the results, the easier to grow the consulting business.

It’s a little bit like a real estate developer: the bigger the assets, the bigger the results. I’ve always considered my content to be the assets of my library.

The more assets I had, the bigger my follower community became, the more traffic to the website I generated, the wider my reach and visibility got, the easier to grow the consulting business. Here’s an overview of the ‘secret weapon’ I was able to unlock for the business.

### Result #1: Speaking invitations - the ‘content flywheel’

I call this the ‘content flywheel’: sharing valuable content leads to receiving speaking engagements, which, in turn, leads to more content opportunities and, as a result, to more speaking engagements, etc.

The ‘content fly wheel’ resulted in almost 100 conference and event invitations over the past decade. It was an incredible amplification of my visibility within my expertise domain.

Many consultancies view ‘speaking’ as too narrow and are not leveraging something I’d call the ‘collateral visibility’.

For me, actually being on a stage and presenting has only been a very small part of the game. It’s the ‘collateral visibility’ that has always been a solid consulting business development engine for me, worth investing a lot of time.

Here are a few ‘collateral visibility’ effects:

• Client leads:encounters with potential consulting clients.

• Social media traffic: substantial visibility before, during, and after the conference/event, which I would often either initiate or amplify.

• Sharing new content:sending my conference presentation to participants (I always added a few ‘extras’ to it) as a way to build trust and strive for new contacts.

• Networking:general networking opportunities, a chance to listen to ‘the typical pains’ of participants (I've always been passioned about carefully listening to the pains and gains of potential clients).

• Flywheel maintenance:meetings with other conference producers (keeping the ‘flywheel’ going) and/or discuss renewed participation in the next year’s conference (I did sent conference participations - with my content - to the most important other conference producers to keep them in the loop of my activities).

• Competition check:listening to and better understanding speaking/exhibiting competitors (this is so so so so important!).

• Self-learning:personal development opportunities (listening to trends, speaking topics, and case studies). I often came back with 20-30 pages of notes that I took during the conference. Prospects and clients always expected me to understand the trends and the industry.

• New content sources:a birthplace of new content ideas (e.g. typical challenges of clients). I always came back home with at least 10 new content ideas.

Going to international conferences, webinars, and trainings is often perceived as the ‘nice side of working at a consultancy’, but for me those were top opportunities for business development and I always tried to leverage every single minute. I loved it!

### Result #2: A rock-solid reputational and digital footprint and following

It has never been easier to get online visibility but, at the same time, it has never been more difficult to convert this visibility into real business opportunities.

Success no longer comes from sharing a few articles or infrequently scattering ‘likes’ on LinkedIn (and I see a lot of consulting leaders doing just that). The game has changed in the past years. Dramatically.

I see many consultancies struggle with the digital and social media jungle, but it’s actually not as difficult as it seems. ‘The game’ is not at all about social media as such, although it remains my most powerful tool to share my existing content.

As a consulting leader, I’ve always been a big believer in (and an active content contributor to) social media.

I invested (and still invest, of course) a lot of time in social media, not only sharing the educational content I post here, but creating original posts – bite-sized advice – on some of the most pressing subjects I see consultancies dealing with.

A few outcomes of my visibility and online footprint:

• Website traffic:at the peak of the iNostix visibility, the website had unthinkable weekly traffic of around 10,000 clicks. This traffic was driven by the content on the blog. Experts were telling me that, given our relatively small company size and the narrow scope of my expertise, this was far beyond their imagination. I successfully replicate this model to generate organic traffic to my current website – The Visible Authority.

• Average time spent on the blog:readers were spending around 3 minutes on our blog, reading on average at least 2 articles. Content researchers report that the average time spent on blogs is about 20-35 seconds! (The iNostix blog got shut down in 2016 due to the Deloitte acquisition.)

• Accumulated sharing of the blogs:almost 1/3 of all articles were shared by the readers via social media - another amazing result!

• Google search 1st-pageappearance:in the ‘golden years’ of iNostix’ visibility, my articles got us on the first page of Google search at least 2 or 3 times for keywords such as ‘HR Analytics’ or ‘People Analytics’. Pure organic traffic, content-driven. For the past three years, my piece onconsulting trends(that I make sure to update at least once a year) has been at the top of Page 1 on Google.

• Twitter influencer of the month:measured by external source NodeXL, I remained in the top 5 ‘global Twitter influencers of the month’ for the hashtag #HRanalytics (until 2016) and in top 10 globally for the hashtag #peopleanalytics (until 2018, even after having closed the iNostix blog due to the Deloitte acquisition).

• A few other ‘events’:content awards (e.g., top 10 articles of the month, top 40 of the year, etc.),media coverage in my markets (e.g. interviews in HR magazines, monthly columns in leading HR magazines in 2 countries, etc.),invitations for jury participation (e.g. in start-up competitions, best people analytics case study competition),many teaching invitations at universities and business schools.

• content awards (e.g., top 10 articles of the month, top 40 of the year, etc.),

• media coverage in my markets (e.g. interviews in HR magazines, monthly columns in leading HR magazines in 2 countries, etc.),

• invitations for jury participation (e.g. in start-up competitions, best people analytics case study competition),

• many teaching invitations at universities and business schools.

Currently, the majority of my traffic is organic – meaning my website shows up for relevant web searches.

### Result #3: The business impact of visibility

And of course, the most relevant and most significant question: did my visibility in the market have an impact on the consulting business growth? Yes, it did. Big time!

• Revenue:the concept is very simple: valuable content = visibility + trust = consultancy growth. Although I never started developing content for monetization purposes as such, I could easily draw a correlation line between the content quality+consistency, the improvement of my visibility, and growing the consulting business. Content definitely gave access to more clients and a more consistent flow of new client leads. I never had to chase new clients. Clients came to me/us instead of me/us having to convince and sell. Inbound instead of outbound. And, by the way, aggressive revenue growth targets (especially after the Deloitte acquisition) were always achieved, with zero marketing!

"Are you generous with your content? If you are not, you are losing! Generosity is an engine for going viral. The more you share, the more you will grow. Selfishness doesn’t spread”. (Josh Spector, social media expert)

• Zero marketing investment:in all these years, apart from my travel costs to conferences, there was zero investment in marketing: no advertising, no campaigns, no marketing materials, no sponsorships, no conference investments (on invitation only), etc. The power of authority is an incredible (free) source of attraction, branding, and consultancy growth.

• Rates:due to my industry visibility as a people analytics expert, I was able to apply premium rates for myself and the team in consulting projects and, only with very few exceptions, they never got questioned. It’s clear from research from around the world that visible experts (no matter at what level: local, regional, or global players) are able to command premium rates.

• Client tenure:during all those years, due to the expert profile in the market, a substantial part of clients became long-lasting client relationships and/or projects. Visible expertise drives client retention and, as a result, overall engagement value!

• Ideal clients:it became clear to me quickly that clear (and sometimes bold) positioning of expertise (due to the content, the speaking engagements, the presence in social media, …) was causing a moreorganic pre-qualificationof clients. People could easily understand what they could get from me and that has always been a big efficiency gain (not wasting time on irrelevant clients).

• Upstream work:due to my position in the market, the majority of the projects were much more high-ticket upstream work for me (strategically focused) instead of low-ticket downstream work (implementation focused).

• Hiring:my strong external visibility has also helped me dramatically in finding the best people to grow the business. I had a constant flow of great profiles who were keen to join us because they had seen, read, and heard a lot about us, our expertise, and our clients. As a result, we had close to zero recruitment costs over a period of almost a decade. Hiring was an organic process on the back of being well-known in the industry.

• Acquisition:I discovered the tremendous power of confidence and peace of mind that prospective clients were looking for when inviting me as an expert. I participated in many proposal pitches and was competing against the Big-4 consultancies on a regular basis. In 90% of the cases, the iNostix proposal seemed to be the best. The feedback: you guys are THE experts. In the years 2014-2015 I received calls from 3 of the big 4 consultancies to check out acquisition possibilities. They cited “a compelling expert profile in the market” as the reason. We proudly landed with Deloitte in 2016: a Gardner upper-quadrant analytics leader with a bunch of inspiring people. What a journey!

## Takeaway

Clients don’t buy from consultancies that they don’t know, don’t like, or don’t trust. So how can firms get their target audience to know and trust them?

I hope I was able to demonstrate that investing in visibility and trust in a consistent and authentic (hard-working) way through educational content can ultimately deliver an incredible impact on the growth of a consulting business.

> “Your narrow positioning is an exercise in irrelevance. The more irrelevant you become to non-ideal prospects by turning your positioning away from them, the more relevant you become to your chosen target clients. But that requires courage and discipline”. — David C. Baker

I am experiencing it every day in my talks to consultancies: most of them struggle with the concept of narrowing their focus to deepen their expertise, their authority, their visibility in the market, their plain growth.

It’s too tempting to focus on creatingwideexpertise instead ofdeepexpertise. They try to cater to numerous types of clients, instead of being a seen as true experts in one area. Keeping the options open. As a result, most consultancies aren’t seeing the results they want.

Conventional wisdom says “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”

Why? Because it’s risky. It’s scary. You must remember, traditional wisdom is inherently risk-avoidant.

However, the traditional wisdom doesn't work if a consultancy wants to achieve insanely levels of success— the kind of success most firms will likely never experience. To achieve that, consultancies need to put all their eggs in one basket.

Focus! Extremely, infinitely, strikingly!

It’s the only way consulting firms can get the truly enormous results that will make them top of mind with their prospects. If a firm's domain expertise is too wide, it’ll invariably attract many clients who aren’t a great fit. The more a consultancy narrows its focus, the closer it gets to better-fit (and higher-paying) clients.

## How to make success in consulting a sure bet

> “Always bet on the man who bets everything on himself.” -old proverb

“Always bet on the man who bets everything on himself.” -old proverb

It's all in the mindset of consulting leaders and, as a result, the culture they create in their consultancies – that of resilience and persistence. These mindset strengths are a must on the road to mastery.

Did you know that 99% of people who start a marathon, finish it? It’s all in the mind.

## The most challenging mountain bike race in the world. And my mindset.

In my 2007-2008 sabbatical year, when I had quit my corporate job, I decided to enroll in the ‘The Untamed’ Cape Epic 8-day stage mountain bike race in South Africa.

It’s the ‘Paris-Dakar’ of the mountain bike sport, with the world elite professionals competing in the front row and about 1,000 hobby bikers behind them (always in teams of 2). It’s broadcasted live on TV in more than 30 countries. It had been my dream for many years.

I teamed up with the numero uno of our mountain bike club, the fastest guy with the best technical riding skills, and a great mechanic too, in case. I felt safe with him on my side.

I had one goal: finish the 8-day race, whatever happened.

I trained almost for a full year with the guidance of a professional cycling coach. Every day, both core body training and cycling of course.

And I trained everything else: sleeping (next to my bed) on a mat (to prepare sleeping in a small tent), sleeping with earplugs (there’s a lot of noise in a tent camp with 1,000 riders, cuffing all night due to the red African sand in their lungs), sitting in a sauna as long as possible (2x per week to get used to the heat), eating/drinking special food/drinks on the bike (to survive 8 hour race days), etc.

My team buddy was laughing at me all the time. What the heck was I doing? Why all these stupid preparations like sleeping on a mat on the floor? It was about cycling and he was the best in town. He didn’t even train the cycling properly, he was the Number 1 guy anyway.

The closer we got to the race, the more I got concerned about his attitude. That race was known for being merciless.

Guess what happened. During the 3rd day, he was taken out of the race by the race ambulance. Fully dehydrated, deadly exhausted (he couldn’t sleep on the mat), completely powerless and mentally drained. His overconfidence turned him into a broken, wrecked guy who turned into an aggressive and angry teammate.

I was allowed to continue the race. I arrived just 7’ ahead of the time limit that 3rd day, due to all the troubles with my teammate.

I finished the race after 8 days.

And I could have continued several more harsh competition days, I felt top fit. I didn’t crash (250 crashes during the race), I didn’t have any technical issues, I didn’t get sick, I slept well, I never got tired despite the fierce circumstances (temperature up to almost 40 degrees). And most of all, I enjoyed it every single minute!

I’ve always been ‘100% in control’ in the race. Ever since then, I am a firm believer in the power of mindset and attitude, which was 50% of my race achievement, you bet.

(Image: Competing in 'The Untamed', the Cape Epic race in South Africa)

Consultancies can change their business bet to be a sure-thing if everyone – from consulting leaders to junior consultants to marketers – set their mind to focus on one single thing and go all the way, as I did in South Africa.

Iterate, adjust, iterate, and adjust again, 100 times.

## The world’s most successful consultancies adopt high-risk, high-reward strategies, repeatedly

There is a common theme among the most successful consulting leaders: these people always seem to have the guts and the courage to play high-risk, high-reward.

The truth is, only a fraction of consultancies and members of the leadership teams I’ve been talking to the past 12 months make a sustainable, carefree living from their work. It sometimes turns me sad because there’s so much opportunity out there!

Thriving consultancies got successful in their narrow, higher-risk fields because they put all their eggs in one basket.

An expert is somebody who benefits from repeated observation and repeated application. So to build deep expertise, you need to study the same sorts of problems over and over again. So you start to see patterns. (Blair Enns)

To build on Blair Enns’ quote: if a consultancy is pitching for a project and it doesn't own deep (and narrow) expertise in the specific domain that’s required, this firm is in the race to the bottom: endless competition of ‘same-as-you’ firms, no negotiation power, buyer expectations to be a well-behaving, obedient follower kinda firm on a low day rate, trivial and risk-free to replace.

The majority of consultancies aren’t making as much money or working with the type of clients/projects they really want.

In most cases, they played the safe, low-risk game for too long. It’s a losing battle in our hyper-connected Google world. Nobody will come across their profile. Google search will put them on page 59, irrelevant as they are, unfortunately. And nobody is coming to rescue them. They don’t get rewarded for trying, failing, or working hard.

*Recommended reading:Positioning in Consulting Is an Exercise in Irrelevance and Here’s Why*

## Consultancies that cater to a wide audience have no future!

When I audit consultancies that offer a long list of services – an attempt to capture as wide of an audience as possible – and without even doing a deep-dive into their performance, I almost always spot that they have:

• poor market visibility

• low traffic to the website (if at all) or profile page

• no systematic lead generation (no T-L-C approach, Traffic to Leads to Clients)

• inefficient social media use

• no/low trust-building expertise-driven educational content and probably needing to say yes to everything to make money (the Jack of all trades).

Why? Because firms with such extensive positioning will always struggle to explain why a prospect should hire them.

If a consultant can’t immediately introduce their firm's specific problem-resolution expertise with all the ins and outs, this consultancy will always lose against their (only 1 click away) competitor who owns the narrow space and has a clear problem solution.

> As a consultant, you need to fully grasp all the details, the background, the context, the relationships, the characteristics, the frequency, the volume, the typical stakeholders involved, etc., of the CRITICAL PAINS OF YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE (in your narrow domain expertise). If you'd cover multiple expertise areas (keeping the options open out of fear to lose income), that’s totally impossible to accomplish.

If you'd cover multiple expertise areas (keeping the options open out of fear to lose income), that’s totally impossible to accomplish.

Consultancies that grow their expertise wide instead of deep will get body-shopped: selling hours for money. And not for particularly high fees either!

## Generalist consultancies usually suffer from the 90/80 challenge!

• Did you know that90%of professional service buyers check out a consultancy's profile online before making a decision to get in touch?

• And did you know that a striking80%of potential firms put themselves out of the picture straight away because of their poor online profile and/or lack of visible expertise?

(data from Hinge Research Institute).

And this is what decision-makers say about consultancies that lead through authoritative thought leadership content, especially in anticipation of hard economic times:(Source:2022 LinkedIn-Edelman B2B Thought Leadership Impact Report)

• 44% of decision-makers say:they will be personally less receptive to sales calls and marketing outreach if a downturn hits.

• 61% say: an organization's thought leadership can be moderately or a lot more effective at demonstrating the potential value of its services compared to traditional marketing.

• 50% say:high quality thought leadership has more impact on their purchase decision-making during economic downturns than when times are good.

• 55% say:as budgets are cut, services deemed nice-to-have rather than must-haves will be where necessary spending reductions come from.

*Recommended reading:(Case Study) Replicate the Secret of This Highly Profitable Consultancy*

Wouldn’t it be great if a consultancy could…

• Get a reliable, steady flow of new clients?

• Get special expert invitations to RFP’s (instead of begging/applying)?

• Have its consultants speak and teach around the world, achieve incredible market visibility, and become go-to experts in their industry?

• Enjoy the magnetic retention of existing clients?

• Succeed with zero or very low marketing costs?

• Prequalify its new clients organically through its content?

• Dare to ask better/higher rates (without getting into persuasion, discussion, or negotiation)?

• Do ‘upstream work’ most of the time (strategic guidance, teaching, and diagnostic-like advice)?

• Have the ability to protect 10-15% of the team's time to re-invest in deepening their expertise, improving their visibility, and actively contributing to business development and revenue growth?

This happened to me in the past years!

Why? I took the risk to put all my eggs in one single basket. To be honest, I’ve always been a rebel by nature. Doing what everyone else is doing always triggered me to do something totally different.

## Consultancies have to make the unsafe choice to achieve the results that 99% of other consultancies will never achieve

Darren Hardy, the best-selling author and entrepreneur, once said: “Successful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.” Looking at people who've built highly successful businesses, this statement certainly rings true.

Making the unsafe choice

Believe it or not but making the unsafe choice has never been easier for consultancies. There are so many ways to succeed — technology, opportunity, and worldwide access have never been more abundant for firms, in many ways leveling the field for small and large firms.

But it still takes courage and guts. Especially in an uncertain economic climate.

When I quit my well-paying CHRO role in 2007 to start a new consulting business from scratch, the world was in the middle of the financial crisis. Everybody was trying to convince me to reverse my decision and to choose the certainty of a corporate executive role.

My inner-circle called me naive and ignorant of what was going on in the world.

By trying to stop me, my over-skeptic inner-circle gave me, Luk-the-rebel, infinite superpowers. I haven’t been afraid of unsafe choices or failure a second because I had a conscious plan and executed it with the highest possible discipline and the deepest possible focus.

9 years later, my consultancy got acquired by Big-4 consultancy firm Deloitte and the awesome team tripled the revenue in no time. 3 years later, I left Deloitte to pass all the learnings of this amazing consulting era in my life to other consulting leaders and their teams.

And to celebrate my radical professional move, I enrolled for my second 8-day Cape Epic mountain bike race in South Africa, at the age of 60 (in 2019). And I successfully accomplished ‘The Untamed’ again. With ease, seriously! And I could have continued several more merciless competition days. Like in 2008.

Talking about unsafe choices...

## In conclusion

Consultancies that want to work exclusively on high-level projects with premium rates and much more meaningful and secure upstream work (strategic/diagnostic) need to make a few unsafe choices, be the rebels.

If you want to live an exceptional and extraordinary life, you have to give up many of the things that are part of a normal one. (Srinivas Rao)

Putting all eggs in one basket is not common advice. But common advice produces common results. Looking at consultancies on the market, there are plenty of "common" firms – usually with challenging and often frustrating project pipeline development.

I always remind myself of a quote from Seth Godin in a keynote I watched on YouTube:‘We get stuck when we are more afraid of the change than we are of staying still’. Wow!

In a world full of opportunity, consulting firms need to overcome their deep-rooted need to respond to every incoming request. They need to be ruthless in discerning what is important and what is just noise.

# The Single Biggest Mistake Consultancies Make: Talking About Themselves

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 20 October 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-single-biggest-mistake-consultancies-make-talking-about-themselves

This article was last updated on 20 October 2022.

“We supercharge our clients to reach maximum performance levels.”

“We are experts in providing our clients with tailor-made guidance to speed-up change.”

“We work at the intersection of marketing, finance and HR.”

“We unbox your digital power.”

“We are the workforce of the future experts.”

These are just a few of the examples of generic BS that I come across daily on consultancies' websites, social media posts, and various marketing collaterals. “We do this", and “We are the best at doing that”, and “We are so experienced and amazing".

The big we-we-we show. And honestly, it’s boring, not attractive at all. Vanilla differentiation. 100% commodity, everybody is saying the same things. Copy/paste.

I have researched over 200 consultants and consultancies in the past two years, and it amazes me that >90% of firms – both large and small – position themselves with this type of generic, self-centered bragging. They call that their USP. Help!

So many consultancies talk about how unique they are, how impressive their offering is, how they spent the last 20+ years perfecting their knowledge and delivering extraordinary services to clients.

My response is: so what?

Consulting clients do not care about the “unique” expertise or offering. They don’t care that a firm's list of services is longer than the Iliad. They want their problems solved! It’s as simple as that.

Many consultancies have been fooling themselves thinking they are unique. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other firms doing the same thing. Maybe even better.

## The big mistake: the inside view

Most consultancies make the big mistake of telling their prospects an inside-in story:

• what THEIR unique services are

• how exceptional THEIR experience is

• how many years of awesome experience THEY have

• and on and on and on...

It’s all about bragging about THEIR so-called unique expertise, unique service, unique blah blah blah.

I encourage leaders of consulting firms to think of their companies' USPs, marketing collaterals, or even the last introductory call one of the consultants had with a prospective client, and count how many times words “I” or “we” were used.

It’s not intentional. But…

Yes, consultancies are selling the ability to deliver services, which, of course, is based on their knowledge, expertise, track record, etc.

So it’s natural for most firms to do just that – talk about themselves and their outstanding qualifications, and I get that and have been there myself.

*Recommended reading:A Consultancy's Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying Decision*

However, this natural tendency is preventing consultancies from actually selling their prospects on their services, from standing out in a crowded market.

Let's reflect on our daily experiences. Say I injured my knee. What am I looking for from a doctor?

It's to correctly diagnose me and prescribe me a treatment that will fix my knee problem.

And what does a doctor do during the first interaction? He asks me questions along the lines of how I injured it, what other symptoms I am experiencing, for how long I’ve had the pain, and whether the pain’s gotten any worse. The doctor doesn’t start the appointment by giving me a breakdown of their services, listing all their fancy degrees, and telling me how many other patients they’ve helped in the last 15 years.

Similarly, it's consultancies' job to diagnose their client’s problem and help eliminate it correctly. It’s all about the clients – their needs, goals, immediate pain points, and long-term expectations.

It’s not what consultancies think it is but what it does to their client.

It’s not about consultancies. It’s about their clients.

## Without a strong UVP, the laws of marketing do not work!

When a consultancy's positioning is all about the firm, the messaging is too generic. OR if they try to appeal to too wide of an audience, they end up wasting precious resources.

*Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design (Without Getting Overwhelmed)*

The marketing laws only work when a consultancy's efforts are tailored to a specific audience with a specific (or prototypical) problem and a specific solution or approach.

• With an inside view, nobody will care about a consultancy's ‘unique expertise’. Clients with significant, pressing problems look for subject matter experts to solve their problems quickly and reliably. Think about the doctor.

• Google won't care about consultancies that put out self-centered bragging on their site. Google's E.A.T. algorithm will not pick up such firms because it doesn’t consider them Experts, Authorities, or doesn’t see them as Trustworthy. They remain the prominent invisible, unknown firms, and nobody is coming to save them.

• These consultancies' client referrals will be weak. If a consultancy is a moderator in the big we-we-we talk show, people won’t know what client impact they can recommend this firm for.

• Thought leadership and trust-building will not work. Consulting companies can’t possibly produce the right problem-resolution content if they keep talking about their consultancy. So they just end up with a ton of useless content and meaningless interactions.

• Their ideal client prequalification won’t work if they are unclear about the prototypical client pains their consultancy solves. They end up with a non-ideal prospect flow, wasting all their time.

Consultancies' vanity claim of being the best, the most unique, the most experienced will never create trust in their consulting expertise.

## Here's what I did: moving to an outside, client-centered view from the start

To be honest, I am struggling to understand why this is such a blind spot among consultancies with all the information around: articles, webinars, books, conferences, you name it.

After my iNostix/Deloitte exit, I started from zero again. It was March 2020, and the world went into lockdown.

Client-centered (the outside view) value proposition design was my driving force.

Here’s what I focused on from the start:

• laser-sharp positioning (the focus of the business) and a clear value proposition, client-driven of course (the outside view);

• a bold and inspiring point of view (often gets forgotten but is an essential component of a consulting value proposition);

• visible and consistent thought leadership (writing-sharing-writing-sharing), openly sharing all my learnings to build trust and help others learn from it.

I commissioned a research study into my niche audience. The goal was to learn everything possible about my prospective clients – consultancies: how they grow their business, what their struggles are, what their business ambitions are, what tools they use, which business models work best for them, and which ones fail. And many, many other things.

I wanted to know my very narrow audience as much as I could to truly understand how to position my offering and develop my value proposition.

Result: I was fully booked after 12 months.

I am 100% convinced every consultancy could do this when it's well-executed.

Here’s my deep belief: Success in consulting is a SIDE EFFECT. What? A side effect? Kidding me, Luk?

I am not kidding. Success in consulting is an output that results from doing positioning and value proposition (combined with stand-out thought leadership) exceptionally well. Everybody can do it – large consultancies, small boutique firms, solo practitioners – starting from scratch.

So here’s what I strongly argue that consultancies do. It's time for them to ditch their useless, self-centered, inside-in USP! Instead, they should focus on designing an outward, client-focused, Unique Value Proposition. Consulting firms need to cancel the big we-we-we show. Immediately.

# Consultancies Must Rethink the Way Their Prospects Buy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 18 October 2022

“How does a prospect become a client in your consultancy?”I posted this question to a group of senior consulting leaders not too long ago during a workshop session.The answers varied greatly and most involved explaining a complex – and, at times, confusing – a process with continuous back-and-forth until the prospect is sent a contract for services that outlines the work and deliverables, ending in both parties signing it.Here’s the thing, though. Most consulting firms I’ve spoken to over the years do not have a clearly defined prospect experience.It’s not like purchasing a piece of software, for example, where you, as a prospect, go to a website, review the features, browse through reviews, sign up for a demo, then purchase the solution – the “self-checkout” process.Considering the direction in which B2B buyers evolve, consulting firms should seriously rethink their prospects’ journey. While it cannot be reduced to the simplicity of buying products, there is a lot that consultancies can do to make the experience of their prospects more aligned with their expectations.I’d like to discuss this in further detail in this article.

## The changing behavior of B2B buyers

Among the consulting trends that I urge firms to pay attention to inthis articleis “Digital marketing will continue to run the show.”

In the article, I explain that B2B buyers take a page from the B2C buyers’ book. They do their own research online, want to see reviews or other types of proof, and want to be able to purchase with a click.

Data backs it up.Research by Gartnershows that 83% of B2B buyers prefer ordering or paying through digital commerce.

Furthermore, when the purchasing process is led by sales representatives, only 24% of B2B buyers complete a high-quality deal. This contrasts with self-navigated purchasing processes, where 65% of B2B buyers complete a high-quality deal.

### Why do self-navigated purchasing processes get better results?

The answer lies in the power of access that digital channels are giving buyers. They no longer depend on brochures and pitch decks sent to them by sales reps or scheduled demos.

Buyers expect to be able to do their ownindependentresearch, evaluate the pros and cons and compare to competitors – all before getting in touch with the vendor to finalize the sale.

On average, buyers complete60% of the buying journey(other research even talks about 70-80%) before they actually engage the vendor. In a way, this takes most of the control away from vendors.

But that’s only if you think of the buying process in an outdated, old-school way.

I believe this empowers the B2B sector by allowing them to carefully plan out and expand their online presence, simplifying and automating the experience of their prospect.

Companies no longer have to have massive sales teams. They can create online journeys and guide prospects through content strategies that generate demand.

The most important mission of the journey: educating the prospects!

## Creating an educative experience for consulting prospects

Of course, we must differentiate between buying a product and buying a service.

And most of the statistics are about products like software, where creating an online check-out process is more feasible. You can’t fully replicate it in the services industry. Consultancies sell time and expertise, not physical or virtual products.

However, changes in buyers’ behaviors do not happen in a vacuum. We develop certain habits and expectations as consumers (in fact, we all became B2C buyers, in a way).

We then start expecting similar experiences as B2B product buyers. These trends ultimately expand into every purchasing decision – be it buying a new washing machine as a consumer or a consulting service as a senior executive.

Consulting firms should pay close attention to buyers' behavior and trends in the B2C sector. It’s only a matter of time before these trends spill over into their prospects’ expectations.

And what started in the B2C space is already 100% true in the B2B space –buyers want ownership over their experience with a product or service.

They want to do their own research, they want informative websites and documentation. Academy-like. They want to quickly understand the value of what a consulting firm can deliver, validated by former clients in similar situations. They want a seamless, self-informed experience.

In short – they want the space to educate themselves before reaching out to a company representative.

### Consulting websites are anything but prospects-education-driven

Despite these pronounced buyer behavior trends, most consulting firms fail to create a seamless, educative user experience.

They continue to use generic buzzwords. They continue to write braggy website copies that are all about “WE do this” and “WE are experts in that”. They fail to engage prospects by showing what problems they address and how they do it.

To understand exactly what a service from a consulting firm would entail, most consulting companies make prospects get in touch with them via a generic form on their site or an email address for one of the consultants. To put it simply, most consultancies’ websites suck.

I dive into details of what I see as the most significant problem areas in consulting websites inone of my postsif you’d like to check it out.

Increasingly, this is not what prospects expect of consulting websites and the type of information they contain!

> "If your website isn’t your most effective source of pipeline & revenue, then something is wrong." (Chris Walker, B2B Marketing Expert and CEO at Refine Labs)

"If your website isn’t your most effective source of pipeline & revenue, then something is wrong." (Chris Walker, B2B Marketing Expert and CEO at Refine Labs)

### How consulting firms can improve the experience for their prospects

As I’ve mentioned, since consulting firms do not sell products but rather the time and expertise of their consultants, they can’t fully replicate the prospect journey of software vendors.

However, they can come close by using the most powerful weapon in their arsenal – audience education through expertise sharing.

Step 1: Get the prospects’ attention with authoritative content

This is all about establishing and growing a consultancy’s reputational footprint.

Firms should continuously produce content that generates demand through audience education. They should create social media posts, case studies, and articles that resonate with their target audience.

This means diving into subjects that prospects most care about – their pain points. And showing solutions. Offering insights that make prospects see their current state in a different light. Educating the audience.

“Your content is your first sales call with a prospect”. (Matt Scianella, Gorilla 76)

*Recommended reading:Shaping Your Consultancy’s Thought Leadership To Accelerate Growth*

Step 2: Demonstrate the ability to resolve pain points

The next step for consulting firms is to clearly demonstrate their ability to resolve their prospects’ pain points on their site.

This should be reflected in individual service pages. Instead of putting up a laundry list of services, firms should show how they can help with specific pain points and needs. Add relevant case studies. Include testimonials from past clients that go beyond “Consultancy X is great” and describe HOW Consultancy X helped this client go from a pain-ridden state to the promised land.

Step 3: Make the collaboration and implementation approach crystal clear

So many prospects struggle to understand what to expect from a consulting firm – what working with one entails. Is it a training session? Is it an audit? Will it take two weeks or two months? What will the prospect get as a final result (what’s the promise of a specific service)?

Once consultancies draw in their target audience through their educational content and demonstrate their ability to resolve their pain points through social proof, they need to explain precisely what collaborating with them entails – an implementation roadmap, if you will.

By clarifying all these questions in a single service page, consultancies empower prospects to decide independently.

Step 4: Encourage the prospects to get in touch

This last step is when consulting firms step into prospects’ experience. At this stage, the prospect is 90% certain they want to go ahead with the consulting firm, and it’s up to individual consultants or firm leaders to confirm and close the deal. This is done via a call, a meeting, or email communication. At this stage, it’s a matter of hashing out the specific details and price points.

> "Consultancies must understand they need to help their prospects how they can move from where they are today, to where they could be tomorrow. Picturing the (self-informed) journey to help the prospect doing his/her ‘homework’ and build the business case to invest in the consultancy."

"Consultancies must understand they need to help their prospects how they can move from where they are today, to where they could be tomorrow. Picturing the (self-informed) journey to help the prospect doing his/her ‘homework’ and build the business case to invest in the consultancy."

## My personal experience guiding prospects to get in touch with me

My advice in this post is based on three things: (1) the B2B trends I notice; (2) the audits of business development approaches of dozens of consultancies; (3) my personal experience.

I’ve covered the first two points. So let me wrap up this post with a brief summary of my experience. Here’s how I engage my prospects:

• I educate my audience. I constantly share my knowledge and expertise. I do it through blog articles, LinkedIn posts, speaking engagements, webinars, newsletters, etc.

• I put pain points into a larger context, helping understand their urgency. This often involves explaining why specific pain points cannot be left unaddressed. I try to shift my readers’ thinking by using my expertise to help them see the bigger picture.

• I break down my services by pages. I can audit a consulting firm’s positioning and create a roadmap for improving it; I can conduct a workshop for senior leadership; or I can offer an immersive learning experience at one of my retreats. Each service page details the problem I’m addressing, why that problem matters, and how I go about helping my clients resolve it.

• I encourage my prospects to get in touch. Each service page features a form or a call-to-action button to schedule a call or get more information about that service. By the time I receive a form submission, the prospect was able to understand what I do, how it matches their needs, what specific service will help them resolve it, and what the service entails. I need to provide very little new information at this point. It’s mainly answering a few logistical questions, discussing fees, and setting timelines.

This is how independent of an experience I strive to provide my prospects. When they fill out the form to contact me, they are sold on my expertise and what I can do for them.

They already read my content. Many of them are already subscribers to my newsletter, so they are very familiar with what I do, who exactly I work with (early disqualification of non-ideal clients), how I can help, and what the process of getting started is all about.

This body of work I share and my prospect engagement channels did all the heavy lifting before I speak to the prospect.

And guess what? My prospects are happy too! At no point do they feel deceived. At no point they feel like they depend on me to get a solid understanding of my services.

They find everything that they need to independently decide whether they’d like to engage one of my services.

## Wrapping up: understanding the buyers’ mind is the starting point

To create a simple, education-driven experience for prospects, consulting firms first need to map out how they recruit new clients and what the current experiences are.

To successfully redesign the experience, firms must first identify which topics their prospects would be most engaged with. Create a list of pain points and start creating content that addresses them and puts them in a larger context.

Consultancies should use their expertise to educate their audience and guide them through easy-to-understand services that offer tangible results.

Buyers do their homework. Consultancies should be the ‘master enablers’ of that homework. The best ‘homework enablers’ will be the winners of tomorrow.

# With a Recession Looming, Consultancies Must Revisit Their Positioning Right Now

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 04 October 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/with-a-recession-looming-consultancies-must-revisit-their-positioning-right-now

---

A recession is looming. We see it all around us as well – both as consumers and businesses. Inflation is rising, contracts are getting put on hold or canceled altogether, gas prices continue to climb, and so on.

Here’s the thing, though. A recession is not all bad news for businesses – certainly not for consulting businesses. It is a shock to the system, but, if prepared accordingly, it can propel the growth of a consulting firm. To achieve business growth during a recession, consultancies must identify opportunities early enough and revise their current positioning.

That’s what I’ll be talking about today – what the upcoming recession means for consultancies and why they should not wait another day to revisit their positioning.

## Why a recession is full of business opportunities

Bain & Company has written anexcellent pieceon how the best businesses plan for the coming downturn. The insight that stands out is thatcompanies tend to make far bigger gains and losses during recession periods than in normal times. Why? Because some foresee and capitalize on opportunities, while others play defense or get stretched thin.

As I said, a recession is a shock to the system. It redefines what we buy, how we prioritize purchases, changes our needs and expectations, creates new pain points, etc. And I’m not talking only about “we” in terms of individual consumers. I’m talking about businesses.

C-level executives realize that the status quo is no longer viable to keep their companies going and tend to make significant changes in more than one way. Some get aggressive about digitalization to optimize costs, others jump straight to cutting operational costs and laying off a significant percentage of the workforce, yet others go on a buying spree, using unstable economic times to acquire smaller companies for much less money.

All these sudden changes create a land of opportunities for consultancies. Suddenly, the market that they cater to develops a whole new range of pain points, which, in turn, means new demand for targeted expertise.

Consultancies that have relevant skills and pivot towards the upcoming needs of their market will be able to use the systemic shock to discover new lucrative opportunities and grow their business.

## Why consultancies should revisit their positioning

Consultancy positioning is the pivotal act of clarifying what problem(s) a consultancy is solving for which specific audience and how their approach is achieving that.

Right now, before the recession fully hits, many consultancies might be positioned perfectly in sync with their current market dynamics. However, what about 2 weeks from now? 2 months? or 12 months? How many consultancies have prepared for a drastic change in the new needs and priorities of their target audience?

> "Good recession planning starts with a realistic assessment of your company’s starting position." (Bain & Company report)

"Good recession planning starts with a realistic assessment of your company’s starting position." (Bain & Company report)

*Recommended reading:Positioning in Consulting Is an Exercise in Irrelevance and Here’s Why*

### Consulting is a resilient business

It’s about filling in the expertise and skills gaps, and the need to hire external experts is not going away. There will always be various areas of expertise that B2B buyers desperately need. How these skills and knowledge gaps are prioritized, on the other hand, is about to change.

Source Global Research studied the types of consulting services that organizations are more and less likely to use in the next 12 months. The specific services are irrelevant for the purpose of this article. What IS relevant, however, is the fact that there is serious fluctuation. Some consulting services are about to be severely de-prioritized, while others will skyrocket in importance.

A consultancy’s positioning is the foundation of everything: external messaging, marketing and business development strategy, client pitches, consulting rates, hiring, and so on. Every aspect of running a business revolves around how this consultancy positions itself to its target audience.

### Finding alignment between expertise and market needs is crucial

You see,alignmentis not just a buzzword. It’s an internal mechanism that ensures that every aspect of the business – marketing, account teams, project teams, senior leadership, etc. – works towards the same goal. This significantly reduces the cost of recruiting new clients and allows consulting firms to move quickly on new opportunities.

The playing ground is about to even out.

Consultancies that do not have their positioning aligned with their market right now and those that do will both find themselves in uncharted territories UNLESS they revise their positioning to align with upcoming market needs.

Consultancies that wait for the recession to hit will be playing catch-up. They will be trying to pivot their positioning once the chaos ensues, once they lose important contracts, and their financial projections get thrown in the trash.

Consultancies that pivot now will be monetizing on opportunities right away. They will be able to recruit new clients, and get enough contracts to fill up their pipeline for the year, and be perceived as market leaders.

So, you see, NOW is the time. Not tomorrow. Not by the end of the year. Not “let’s see where the chips fall before we make any moves”. Now.

## How consultancies can go about the process of revising their positioning

Positioning is not the vision of a consultancy. It’s not a brand definition. It’s not the external messaging or a marketing strategy.

Positioning is a lot more foundational than all these individual parts. It’s about zooming in on the target audience's needs, understanding how they prioritize those needs and determining the most optimal way to resolve the top-of-the-list pain points with effective consulting expertise and/or services.

It’s only once you clarify this foundational aspect of a business that consultancies can move on to their marketing and business development strategies, external messaging, etc.

> "Creating a laser-sharp positioning might be the most crucial decision consulting leaders must make (and maintain). Most consulting firms could make a huge step forward by spending more time to create (and permanently update) a more robust positioning definition and become better (upstream) strategic advisors. But it needs guts and courage."

"Creating a laser-sharp positioning might be the most crucial decision consulting leaders must make (and maintain). Most consulting firms could make a huge step forward by spending more time to create (and permanently update) a more robust positioning definition and become better (upstream) strategic advisors. But it needs guts and courage."

### The four steps of assessing positioning

First, consultancies must see where they currently stand vis-a-vis their clients’ needs. This should be done in a structured way to get a rounded picture. We are currently working on a recession-driven offering review with a mid-sized consulting firm, and this is our review approach:

• We have provided a brief training on re-checking clients' situation, objectives, priorities, and pain points. This is done via check-in calls, meetings, questionnaires, feedback inquiries, etc. The goal is to determine whether what clients care about right now is significantly different from what you’ve currently presumed / to what your current positioning and messaging speak to.

• We will then use these insights to assess the consultancy's promises to its CURRENT prospects and clients. This means reviewing all the opportunities and deals currently in the pipeline to see if any might be at risk or benefit from the consultancy checking in (and potentially re-scope or even re-negotiate).

• We will use the insights from CURRENT clients to assess the promise to FUTURE clients – i.e., prospects.We will help the consultancy determine whether, given the identified changes, changes are needed to how the firm applies or “packages” its expertise.

• Finally, all findings will be summarized in an “issues list”. We recommend that consultancies consider it a to-do list of what needs changing, why, and how.

*Recommended reading:How Consultancies Can Get Started With Value Proposition Design (Without Getting Overwhelmed)*

### The seven steps of repositioning

Alright, once a consultancy audits its positioning, finds gaps between its current offering and its existing client's needs, and puts together the list of issues identified during the assessment, it’s time to develop new positioning. Here are the seven steps that I recommend consultancies follow:

• Create internal alignment around your “issue list” and the next steps. The consultancy will need all hands on deck to make such a fundamental change. I’m talking EVERYONE, from senior leadership to entry-level researchers.

• Work with key stakeholders to identify key target segments and the client issues within these to focus the repositioning exercise on. This involves answering questions like:- “Will our current client profile allow us to continue to grow our business and charge premium fees, or do we need to focus on a new audience?”- “If the audience is the same, what are the changing pain points that are most likely to become a priority for our clients and prospects?”- “How closely does our expertise match these upcoming needs? Are we in a position to help our clients resolve these problems?”- “What skills should we focus on and specialize deeper in to continuously deliver value to our clients?”

• Work with key stakeholders to change how expertise is presented to said segments. This is where consultancies should work on the basic messaging – what they do, how they do it, and how prospects can benefit. It’s a 30-second pitch if you will.

• Work with key stakeholders to change how expertise is applied and packaged within said segments. What does the new service offering involve? To address the identified new needs of clients, does the consultancy need to offer a 1-month or 12-month service? Would it require a team or a single consultant? What technologies will be used? What results can be promised to clients? All of this determines how a service is presented and sold to prospects.

• Summarize the changes in a new positioning and messaging framework. This is where consultancies would take into consideration everything they’ve learned about the changes in the market and all the ways they’ve identified to pivot their services to match these market needs as closely as possible, and then summarize them in a short, cohesive statement.

• Validate with clients and prospects, refine if necessary. Consultancies will save themselves a lot of time and energy if they first validate their new positioning before rolling it out to the market and internally. They should talk to their existing clients and see how they respond to the new positioning. They should use it to pitch prospects. If any gaps are still present between what the market needs/will need and the new positioning, firms should continue to refine until they are satisfied that the new positioning perfectly fits the brewing pain points of their niche audience.

• Share internally and do it often. Consultancies must ensure that everyone within their organization knows and understands the new positioning. Marketers should revise their strategy to match the new positioning. Sales should adjust their pitch. Consultants should adjust their communication with existing clients. Research teams should focus their work on the new client profile/new client needs. Employees must be aware of the new positioning and communicate a uniform message.

> "Know your consulting client. Get inside their hearts, souls, and minds. Try to know them better than they know themselves. Take this knowledge and drive it into everything you do. When a prospective client bumps into you, they should say, “These people get me.”" (Greg Alexander, from the book ‘The Boutique’)

"Know your consulting client. Get inside their hearts, souls, and minds. Try to know them better than they know themselves. Take this knowledge and drive it into everything you do. When a prospective client bumps into you, they should say, “These people get me.”" (Greg Alexander, from the book ‘The Boutique’)

## In conclusion: proactively review the consultancy’s positioning to avoid being late to the game.

There’s a 98.1% chance of a global recession happening in 2023,saysNed Davis Research. However, consultancies should reframe their thinking around the recession. Instead of focusing on all the contracts they will lose out on, all the employees they will be forced to let go, and all other budgetary cuts they will have to make, they should focus on the opportunities.

Consulting is a resilient business. Consultancies can grow and prosper in times of economic uncertainty. Uncertainty requires guidance, it requires expertise. B2B buyers will be looking for the right type of expertise and reliable consultancies to deliver this expertise.

When positioned in line with buyers' most pressing needs and pain points, consultancies will be able to weather out the storm and exponentially grow their business. They will be on a hunt for talented experts in the field to add to their teams. They will be in the position to charge premium fees. These firms will emerge from the recession as true market leaders.

So the single most important message I want consultancies to take away from this post is DO NOT WAIT. Future-proof and recession-proof your consulting businesses now.

# Positioning in Consulting Is an Exercise in Irrelevance and Here’s Why

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

---

The title of this article is inspired by David C. Baker, fromhis awesome book ‘The business of expertise’.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve been working with consultancies on how to leverage their expertise to add value to their clients.

However, the one thing that an overwhelming amount of this work has been coming down to ispositioning. It is such an important foundational element that nothing else matters until a consultancy gets this part right.

Marketing and business development strategies will not produce consistent results. The consultancy will play catch-up, trying to win clients by lowering fees and sending dozens of follow-up emails.

I share quite a bit about the importance of positioning through my LinkedIn posts.

Since I tend to focus on one reason at a time, I thought I’d bring a few of the main posts together to help you, my reader, understand and internalize the significance of correctly positioning your consultancy.

## What positioning is and isn’t

David C. Baker calls positioning an exercise in irrelevance. Interesting view.

Michael Porter would say, in the spirit of David C. Baker: it’s about deciding what you don’t want to do (to get clear about what you do).

Here’s how I always explain positioning:

Consultancy positioning is the pivotal act of clarifying the problem(s) your consultancy is solving for a specific audience and how your approach is achieving that.

Clumsy consultancy positioning weakens the result of everything you do in marketing, business development, value proposition design, service development, thought leadership, team management, hiring, etc.

Creating a laser-sharp positioning might be the most crucial decision consulting leaders must make. Really.

Most consultancies suffer from a sub-optimal positioning quality, which translates into the target audience or market having no clear idea of what the consultancy exactly does, how it’s done, and why it is of value to them.

Moreover, without a high-quality positioning, there’s no proper framework to organize priorities, client work, educational efforts, and the business development process.

### How positioning fits in the larger context of a consultancy’s business development

Positioning is the foundation of everything a consultancy does and how it markets itself.

It’s the ultimate starting point and the framework that needs regular evaluation to ensure it continues to sync with the target audience’s needs.

When working with consultancies, I always use my ‘Business Development Quadrant’ to showcase the 4 areas of business development success.

However, it all starts with positioning in square 1, see the visual below.

If positioning isn’t well defined (in way too many cases, unfortunately), the other business development objectives - growing visibility, building social proof (or trust), and nurturing the relationships/network (to scale it) - will be underperforming.

Here’s the business development quadrant to help you understand how positioning fits in the larger context of your business:

In this business development quadrant, your consultancy should be able to answer the following questions:

• Positioning:Is it clear what problem gets solved for which target audience and with which problem resolution (expertise)?

• Visibility:Is the consultancy widely known and seen as the go-to experts in the market/industry? Does work come directly to the consultancy, reliably and consistently?

• Social Proof:Has the consultancy built referral cases to attract similar ideal clients for a similar type of work?

• Network:Does the consultancy systematically nurture its prospects, existing AND former clients with new findings, cases, experiences, latest trends, technology updates, etc?

Remember: Clumsy consultancy positioning weakens the result of everything you do in marketing, business development, value proposition design, service development, thought leadership, team management, hiring, etc.

## Recession? Why every single consultancy must revisit its positioning right now

In general, I advise consulting leaders to constantly check in on their positioning, its continued relevance, and alignment every quarter or so. And an annual big, foundational review.

Recession? Time to review the consultancy’s positioning.

Ask yourself, do you need to revisit your consultancy’s positioning to determine whether it requires changes due to what’s going on in our world?

Analysisby Bain & Company shows that companies make far more significant gains and losses during recession periods than in normal times. Why? Because some foresee and capitalize on opportunities, while others play defense or get stretched thin.

I know first-hand that this is indeed the case. I started my consultancy at, what some people saw as the most inopportune time – right as the pandemic started. People panicked. Companies panicked. International travel got canceled overnight. I don’t need to remind you what a nightmare it was for all of us on individual and business levels.

Yet, in this time of complete chaos and budget cuts, my consultancy grew. Why? Because I was offering a service that consultants and consultancies were keen to learn – I was teaching how to grow a consultancy in difficult (pandemic) times.

I quickly adjusted my positioning in the context of the pandemic. Contextual finetuning because my expertise didn't change overnight. And so did - contextual adjustments - many other brave and smart consultancies.

So, here’s my message to the reader…

Irrespective of how your consultancy is doing at this very moment, you must revisit your positioning with an eye on the upcoming recession.

What will your target audience look for the most? Which areas of their business will or will not get slashed? What new pain points are going to emerge? Do you need to deepen certain expertise areas and double down on them?

If you position your consultancy right, the upcoming recession can be an attractive growth opportunity.

## 7 business reasons why a consultancy needs to get its positioning right

### #1. A poorly positioned consultancy will always struggle to explain the typical outcomes of its work.

I’ve met my fair share of consultancies in Zoom calls that gave me a 10-minute spiel about what they do. Typically they start listing all their services and talk on autopilot about how unique, experienced, and passionate their firm is.After 3 minutes, they’ve already ‘lost’ me. My traditional feedback: the prospect doesn’t want to hear this inward-looking, ‘commercial’ consulting gibberish.The prospect is looking for problem-resolution support and wants to understand what can be achieved with the help of the consultancy.Prospects are looking for possible OUTCOMES instead of a laundry list of services in the ‘this-is-what-we-do’ style.

*Recommended reading:The Single Biggest Mistake Consultancies Make: Talking About ThemselvesSo stop saying, “Here’s what we do” and start saying, “Here’s what clients typically achieve when working with us.”That’s an expertise-based, differentiating consulting approach, outcome-led, with a premium pricing vision. And it’s only achievable with strong positioning.*

Here’s what I use in my LinkedIn ‘About’ to explain outcomes:

• A crystal clear positioning with a specific value proposition for a well-defined target audience

• A top-of-mind reputation for solving prototypical problems and getting invited as domain authorities

• A substantially higher market/industry visibility, by consistently educating the target audience

### #2. Without laser-sharp positioning, consultancies struggle to differentiate

Poorly positioned consulting firms have no choice but to compete on pricing. They don’t have any other way of differentiating what they do from hundreds of other firms on the market.

If it’s not crystal clear who the target audience is, what problem(s) can be solved for them, and how expertly the consultancy goes about, you will find yourself in an uphill battle you can never win.

And in the long run, the poorly positioned consultancy will completely exhaust everybody on the team (causing severe consultant retention challenges).

Competing on pricing is toxic in the long run and will erode a consultancy’s reputation and organic growth.

In working with consultancies, these 5 self-assessing questions are part of a positioning exercise that helps to get more explicit about the target audience and its problems to be solved.

As a consulting leader, can you answer these questions about your clients?

• What has changed (over time) in your client’s world that causes the pain points they are confronted with?

• What impact are these changes and pain points causing on your client's everyday work or organization?

• What is the shift your client needs to make to get pain relief?

• What exactly is the consultancy’s expertise that can bring such pain relief?

• What’s the client’s business case for solving these pain points?

• What will/can happen over time if your client isn’t getting into action? What are the potential cost and the risk of inaction?

If you can’t ask these questions straight away, something might be wrong with your positioning. Back to the drawing board.

### #3. Strong positioning gets your consultancy into more doors

Say you are at a conference and a prospect asks you what your consultancy does. Can you explain it in 60 seconds?

Here’s what your response should be:

• We are known by [specific audience]...

• for our ability to solve [specific pain point(s)]...

• and deliver [specific outcome(s)]...

• thanks to our [specific approach].

This is how you get a prospect instantly on the hook. In under a minute, you explained why your consultancy is a valuable asset to your target audience. This is how you thrive as a consultancy even in a recession or difficult economic times.

If you can’t explain in 60’, gather the leadership team and go back to the drawing board because a reliable pipeline of easy-to-qualify opportunities is at stake.

And never forget: if it’s easy to explain what the consultancy can achieve, it’ll be much easier to get recommended. Most consultancies underestimate the power of recommendation because of the clarity of positioning.

### #4. Multiple positionings, each tailored to its own target audience, deliver stronger results than a single, overly general positioning.

Multiple audiences? Multiple expertise domains? Multiple markets or industries? Well, you will need to run multiple positioning exercises! Yes.

Every audience, expertise domain, and market has its own challenges and pain points.

Consultancies cannot position themselves at the overarching brand level. Positioning always takes place at the level of the pain points of the specific client and the expertise that can help those clients.

Brands don’t solve problems. Expertise does.

Prospects with a problem don’t search for ‘which brand can help me’ (top-down, so to say). They search for a problem resolution. And that takes place at the expertise level (bottom-up, so to speak).

Consulting firms cannot develop the business in an optimal way without a clear decision on who they are, what they do, and for whom they have an unparalleled problem resolution.

With large firms with multiple practices and, as a result, multiple target audiences, each practice should have its own positioning. Think of every practice as its own highly-narrow expertise-driven boutique consultancy. Then develop positioning for that consultancy practice.

### #5. Strong positioning helps individual consultants build their personal reputation that further strengthens the consultancy’s reputation

The market is crowded. It’s crowded with consultancies large and small and millions of independent consultants available with a click. Your firm and its consultants will get lost in this noise without a clear message delivered to a specific audience.

Strong positioning gives your consultants a focus and a sense of direction. It helps them understand who they are talking to and how they should go about doing it. This makes their leading thinking more targeted and powerful, which, in turn, helps them build and grow their personal reputation and, by extension, your consultancy’s reputation on the market.

As Roland Gurney (agency marketing expert) brilliantly puts it:

> “Positioning is sharpening the axe. Get it right and your messaging, marketing, hiring and growth become much easier.”

“Positioning is sharpening the axe. Get it right and your messaging, marketing, hiring and growth become much easier.”

### #6. Diversification doesn’t protect consultancies from uncertainty. Strong positioning does.

In consulting business development, it’s all about making choices. And that’s exactly what doesn’t happen enough. Consulting leaders tell me: "We have diversified the past years to protect us from economic risk".

I was reading this consulting tagline on a website (amongst thousands of others writing the same stuff): "We are consulting at the intersection of strategy, organization, data, and AI".

Yes, this was a real tagline!

I guess they are considering themselves as a nicely diversified consulting firm. That type of positioning (‘we work at the intersection of XYZ’) would be my utter nightmare. I wouldn't know how to explain prototypical project outcomes of such 'an intersection'. Do you know?

I am a big disbeliever in such a so-called 'protection-driven diversification positioning'.

Focus and specialization are much better protection. Way, way better. And way easier to manage. And that can only come from a laser-focused positioning.

A lot of the diversification hassle in consulting firms is just a bloody stupid legacy problem of having added and added and added services in the past because the leaders believe they can make more money and protect them from economic risk by adding more services.

Or they just hired a new partner from yet another expertise domain.

Many of the diversified consulting firms are telling me the ‘risk protection story’ because they weren’t able to focus, or weren’t able to agree on the direction amongst the leaders, heck.

Life in a highly diverse consulting firm is difficult from a business development standpoint. It requires tremendous efforts, including constantly hiring people with all kinds of expertise (not easy today), and it requires a lot of training time for these people. You can be growing on paper, but each step in this growth comes at increasingly unjustified costs (and lower margins).

Based on my experience (and available data), these multi-diverse consultancies are somewhere between 20-50% less profitable compared to a single-focused consultancy.

Shortsighted diversification is a leaking margin bucket.

Don’t believe me? Well, show me a consultancy P&L, and without knowing anything about that consulting firm, I am almost 100% sure I can ‘smell’ it’s either a focused or an unfocused/diversified consulting firm.

Trivial diversification, in almost 90% of the cases, (I repeat myself), is pulling consulting firms into a downstream rate game because they compete on almost everything and rarely have power in the sale as experts.

Why? Because there’s no clear positioning, no target audience with specific pain points to solve, there’s fluffy expertise demonstration (because there’s too much to demonstrate), and the laws of consulting marketing won’t work (building trust and demand at scale).

### #7. Prospects struggle to get approval for working with poorly positioned consultancies

You probably never really thought about this #7 challenge, right?

Prospects don’t care about your consulting services. They care about their very own new ‘future state’.

And yet, almost every consulting firm is making that mistake: they are positioning themselves with their services. What consulting firms don’t seem to understand is that the prospect will need to pitch internally to get the budget to pay the consultancy’s invoices.

The likelihood this prospect will get the budget by explaining ’I need consulting service X’, is close to zero.

But chances are totally different when the prospect pitches for ‘getting budget to solve pressing problem X and to move to future state Y (or achieve outcomes ABC) with the experienced help of consultancy Z’.

If a consultancy can enable the prospect to do a strong ‘future state pitch’ by showing possible outcomes of the collaboration, such a consultancy will easily outpace the competition.

Armed with a compelling future state narrative (enabled by the consultancy), prospects are more likely to get others on board to get project approval (and the budget).

Likewise, your past clients are more likely to help you generate future business by testifying about similar outcomes from previous projects.

Doesn’t that make you more and more convinced about the power of laser-sharp positioning? And narrow focus?

## The good news, the need to update a consultancy’s positioning is often a sign of growth

Be happy, be positive. Positioning reviews and updates are great. I love them. Because it’s a sign of growth, development, reflection, of getting in sync with new evolutions in the market.Whether it’s because the current positioning is weak or because you’ve outgrown it as a firm, re-working your consultancy’s positioning is making progress. It’s a symptom of taking the consulting business to the next level.Positioning is never set in stone. On the contrary.Your consultancy might have been primarily focused on execution-type of work. However, over the years, the consultancy’s expertise has deepened and has achieved a higher altitude of involvement, strategic advisory – upstream-type of work.The positioning of the consultancy should resemble such a transition: redefinition of the ideal client, client pain points, and problem resolution approach.I’ve provided 7 solid reasons why positioning should be the #1 priority as a consultancy to grow the business or make it more profitable.It all comes down to the simple analogy – we can’t build a big, beautiful house on a wobbly foundation and expect it to last. We will always be investing in repairs, upkeeps, and various costly projects until it inevitably crashes.A consultancy simply can’t afford to waste marketing and business development efforts, hire for the wrong reasons or the wrong people, or waste client generation opportunities.

And this is precisely what’s happening if a consultancy is poorly positioned and is communicating hundreds of incoherent messages to the market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does one effectively measure the success or failure of a consultancy's positioning strategy? Are there specific metrics or indicators that can be used to evaluate positioning beyond anecdotal evidence or intuition?

Evaluating the effectiveness of a consultancy's positioning strategy requires a multifaceted approach. Metrics such as client acquisition rates, client retention rates, average deal size, and the percentage of qualified leads generated from marketing efforts can provide quantitative insights into the impact of positioning on business outcomes. Additionally, qualitative indicators such as client feedback, market perception surveys, and industry recognition can offer valuable perspectives on how well the consultancy's positioning resonates with its target audience.

### Can you elaborate on any common pitfalls or challenges that consulting firms encounter when attempting to refine or adjust their positioning strategies, and provide recommendations for overcoming these obstacles?

Refining or adjusting positioning strategies can indeed present several common challenges for consulting firms. One common pitfall is a lack of clarity or consensus among team members regarding the firm's unique value proposition and target audience. This can result in inconsistent messaging and confusion in the market. Overcoming this challenge often involves conducting thorough internal discussions, market research, and stakeholder interviews to align perspectives and define a cohesive positioning strategy. Additionally, external factors such as evolving market trends or competitive landscape changes may necessitate periodic adjustments to positioning. By staying vigilant and responsive to these dynamics, consulting firms can mitigate potential pitfalls and maintain relevance in their positioning.

### You mention the importance of regularly revisiting and potentially updating a consultancy's positioning over time. Could you offer insights into the typical frequency or triggers for conducting these reviews, and provide guidance on how to effectively assess the relevance and effectiveness of existing positioning in evolving market conditions?

The frequency and triggers for conducting positioning reviews may vary depending on factors such as market volatility, changes in client needs, or shifts in industry trends. Typically, consulting firms should consider revisiting their positioning at least annually as part of their strategic planning process. However, significant market disruptions, economic downturns, or shifts in competitive dynamics may warrant more frequent reviews. Additionally, key milestones such as entering new markets, launching new service offerings, or experiencing significant growth or contraction may also signal the need for a positioning reassessment. During these reviews, consulting firms should evaluate the alignment between their current positioning and market demand, solicit feedback from clients and stakeholders, and identify opportunities to refine or adjust their messaging to better resonate with target audiences. By proactively monitoring and adapting their positioning in response to changing market conditions, consulting firms can maintain relevance and competitive advantage over time.

# Shaping Your Consultancy’s Thought Leadership To Accelerate Growth

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 06 September 2022

“My team has been putting in a lot of effort into creating premium content that showcases our consultancy’s expertise. But not much is happening.”

This is a copy-paste from one of the email chains with a prospective client early on in our communication.

This subject comes up often. In fact, the lack of ROI is one of the most common frustrations and objections that I encounter with consultancies.

There are several reasons why your firm’s thought leadership content is not driving its business development.

One big reason is the lack of a clear goal or strategy that consulting firms use when crafting every piece of content.

Here’s the problem. If you don’t have a goal, how can you measure success? How do you even begin to define “success” and “success metrics”?

If you don’t have an overarching strategy, how do you decide on what the right topic for your content is? How do you determine when to make adjustments? How do you tie it all together?

My strong belief – and a tried-and-tested method – is that consultancies must frame all their expertise-driven content efforts to generate demand.

That’s exactly what I’ll be discussing in this article: what demand generation is, why you need it, and how to go about it.

## Why is your consultancy’s expertise-driven content not converting?

Not all content is thought leadership. And not all thought leadership content generates the same ROI and business development results.

As I explained in myarticleon why consulting leaders can’t outsource their expertise-driven content generation to marketing, true leading-thought content requires deep expertise in a narrow field.

It can’t be a superficial-level piece that anyone can put together with 2-3 hours of research.

> The new archetype consulting firm, openly sharing its expertise, doesn’t worry about making money but about educating its target audience to help them solve their problems. The result of not worrying about money is that they will make more money.

The new archetype consulting firm, openly sharing its expertise, doesn’t worry about making money but about educating its target audience to help them solve their problems. The result of not worrying about money is that they will make more money.

However, as you get your consultants in the habit of producing thought leadership content regularly, it’s equally important to communicate the goal of such pieces and the best approaches that can achieve business development results.

### We live in a buyers' market

Remember, 70-90% of the ‘selling’ is done before prospects even engage with consultancy firms. They Google your firm and individual consultants. They browse through LinkedIn posts and case studies. They check out the feedback from past clients. They connect with peers in their industry. They exchange experiences in groups and communities. They check out reviews, expecting 5-star assessments from former clients.

The buyer has unlimited information, immediately available at the fingertips.Now, say your consultancy deals with marketing technologies. Your consultants can write in-depth reviews of products. They can offer insights into the market and make expert observations about upcoming trends. These are great pieces, but in this form, they will not get your consultancy far.Why? Because they are not inspiring actions among the buyers who are coming across this content. These types of pieces are not encouraging their readers to change anything about their current way of being or to shoot a message to your consultancy. Sure, they areeducating, but they are notselling.

### Business development is rooted in education

Yes, educating your audience should be at the base of your consultancy’s marketing and business development strategy. However, the goal is to motivate your target audience to reach out to you with an inquiry about your services. That’s the prism through which you need to create the body of work.Furthermore, failing to unify your consultants’ marketing efforts around very specific, tangible goals means you can’t accurately measure your progress over time. You simply can’t compare the performance of different pieces if you don’t have a roadmap you’re following and are using to compare the results against.

## What is demand generation?

Demand generation is an approach to content marketing that aims to generate interest among the target audience in the product or service you sell.

In consulting, demand generation-driven content is based on two pillars:

• Audience education: This is how you demonstrate your firm’s expertise. This is how you build trust and increase awareness. Your content authoritatively proves your consultants’ deep expertise and a thorough understanding of the target audience.

• Audience action: This is how you motivate your audience to reach out to your firm. You need to give them a reason to want to change their current status and hire your consultants to help them do it.

*Recommended reading:Without Thought Leadership, Consultancies Will Fail*

Going back to my example of a marketing tech consultancy. As I said, explaining the current market and upcoming trends can showcase your consultants’ expertise. You can check off “audience education” with this type of content.

However, to turn pieces like this into demand generation-driven content, you must take it a step further.

• You can, for example, explain why it is detrimental that companies align their marketing stack around a single solution – failing to do that will cost them a lot of money and is unsustainable in the long run.

• You can explain why the trend that you predict for next year MUST be acted upon this year. Failing to do so now may result in costly fines, significantly longer downtime periods, dissatisfied customers, and so on.

Encourage action. Encourage change. Explain the problem, explain the solution, and demonstrate your superior ability to solve the pain point and deliver strong results.

That’s how you generate demand with your expertise-driven content.

### How I organize my content to generate demand for my expertise

Over the years, I developed my signature style in content. Most of my readers can recognize my pieces just by reading the first paragraph.

The ability to develop my unique voice is a by-product of certain habits and the mindset that I had developed.

I usually start with theWHAT. I try to use real-life examples of problems my audience faces. Or place a pain point in a larger context. This part is really easy. I have a giant Google doc where I copy-paste emails and add notes from Zoom calls with prospects whenever they bring up an objection, a hesitation, or a problem they are facing. All I have to do, just like I did here, is go into that pool of inspiration and pick a problem that I’d like to address with my post.Then, I explain theWHY. Why is this problem happening? What is the root cause of this specific pain point? Is this problem a result of internal or external factors?

I then proceed to explain theHOW. This is the advice part of my pieces. I offer an alternative route. I explain how my target audience can use this different approach to not only solve their pain point but the transition to a much better place – stronger business results, organic growth, better efficiency, happier clients, etc.

Finally, I try to close off my pieces with theNOW. I explain why continuing to stay in the current state damages my audience. I urge them to use the knowledge that they’ve acquired from my piece to take action today.

My trick? I want to make my audience feel comfortable with the idea of change. Because change is scary. Change is uncertainty. And many of us hesitate to take that next step.

That’s why I like to give practical suggestions on how to start small and build up from there. It’s not as scary when it’s gradual. It’s not as scary when it’s one step at a time. As long as you get moving today.

## How to rock demand-gen audience education as a consulting business development strategy?

Here are three methods you can start using right away when putting together thought leadership content that educates your audience to generate demand. You can mix and match them depending on the topic.

• Shift the potential client’s thinkingHere, the goal is to explain common practices, approaches, strategies, and beliefs within your target audience members. Then, show them why it’s not the most optimal one. Explain the alternative – your strategy, your approach, your practices. Provide evidence of why the alternative will deliver significantly stronger results for your target audience.

• Picture the transformational potentialIn these pieces, your main goal is to convince your audience that changing their status quo is necessary. Paint a picture of what waits for them on the other side. It can be significantly higher productivity, lower costs, exponential business growth, high retention rate, etc. This way allows your audience to draw a mental comparison between their current state and what could be.

• Explain the cost of inactionHere, you need to use your deep expertise to educate your audience on why maintaining the status quo is a bad idea. For example, my argument to my audience is that failing to offer highly specialized services to a narrow audience means your consultancy is racing to the bottom, given the dynamics of the market and shifts in buyer habits.

Use these three methods to formulate the concept of your article and create an outline. As you do it repeatedly, you will notice that it becomes a natural part of your content production, whether it’s an article, a conference presentation, or a social media post. It just becomes a mindset.

## What formats should your consultants keep in mind when educating their audience?

Finally, let’s talk about content formats for your demand generation approach.

There are different mediums for communicating your expertise, educating your audience, and inspiring action. I’ll use examples from my expertise-driven body of work to illustrate the formats.

First, you haveblog articles. I use blog posts, like this one, to dive deep into topics. Most of my pieces are longer than 1,000 words. I realize that it’s quite a bit to read, which is why I try to structure my writing. I make sure to use titles and subtitles, organize my thoughts into bullet lists, etc. Blog posts are currently my main medium for educating my audience and generating demand for my expertise.

I also have a rich portfolio as a conference speaker.Presenting at eventsis yet another opportunity to educate your audience by deeply diving into a topic. I usually do a case study, explain a pain point and offer a solution, or highlight my prediction of trends and what their impact is going to be on my target audience.

In 2021, I hosted a series ofwebinars. Here, I would zoom in on a specific problem and coach my audience on the proven methods that help overcome that problem. I would always make it a point to explain the importance of changing the approach I’m suggesting and show evidence of how this approach delivers results.

I usesocial media posts, LinkedIn especially, to communicate one thought at a time. I know that people tend to scroll through their feed and don’t have the patience to read essays. So I try to keep my posts focused on a single thought. My goal here is to engage my audience, source their thoughts, to gauge their interest. I don't put any links in my posts (except on Saturdays) e.g. to my website/blog content. I am sharing my thinking straight 'in the feed' of my followers. It's where I meet my target audience, who don't like to move away from Linkedin to read my other content.

Finally, I use mynewsletterto deliver the most important content to my busy readers. I offer a breakdown of my LinkedIn posts, I provide an in-depth piece on a specific subject, I provide a relevant piece of evidence – a statistic – to further educate my audience and shift their thinking, and I end with a list of my services that they can benefit from.

### Recycle, repurpose, update, and reformat your content

I publish a lot of content. I produce a few long blog posts per month, I create ebooks and guides a couple of times a year, I publish posts on LinkedIn almost daily, and every now and then, I also do guest posts or podcasts.

And no, I’m not driving myself crazy, writing and composing for hours daily. In fact, I don’t spend more than 3 hours per week on my content.

My secret – though, it’s not really a secret since I’ve been actively promoting this approach – is to recycle, repurpose, update, and reformat my content.

I put a lot of effort into creating larger pieces. These blog posts are at the core of my content strategy. I then put these larger pieces through my content machine. I extract individual thoughts and share them in a short format on LinkedIn. I gather statistics from various articles and turn them into an infographic (well, my marketing assistant does – her design skills are superior to mine). I take a recording of my webinar and break it down into main takeaways and also publish it in article form.

Furthermore, I make sure to update my older pieces regularly. As the market changes, I want to ensure that my content remains relevant. So I finetune my articles – some yearly, some more often than that. As a result, I can use an article I originally published two years ago and put it through another spin in my content machine.

### Pay attention to the visual consistency of your content

This is my last piece of advice for today.

As your consultancy transitions towards producing demand generation-driven leading thought pieces, get in the habit of ensuring they are visually consistent.

As a medium-sized or large consultancy, this is the job you can easily pass on to your marketing team. Have them create featured images for your posts, cover art for podcast episodes, infographics, the design of ebooks, the design of presentation slides for speaking engagements, etc.

Having brand consistency across your visuals will allow your audience to instantly recognize your firm’s content.

## In conclusion

“Content marketing”, and “thought leadership” – are all very general terms. On their own, they do not mean much for business development in consulting. Once you actually get on the path of content marketing and thought leadership, you need to define very specific goals and map out a strategy that will get you there. Otherwise, you can end up spending 10 hours a week producing insightful pieces and see no meaningful results.

OR, you can take on the demand generation approach – channel your leading-thought content towards motivating change in your target audience’s way of thinking and behavior. This is when you will start seeing an increase in the ROI of your consultancy’s thought leadership efforts. This is when audience education becomes a business development machine.

And you don’t even have to start from scratch. Go back to your old pieces. Read them and ask yourself: “How can I update this case study/post to make it action-driven? What do I want my audience to do with this knowledge that I’m sharing?” And then share, repurpose, recycle, and do it all over again.

# Consulting Leaders, Stop Outsourcing Your Thought Leadership Responsibility to Marketing!

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 23 August 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/consulting-leaders-stop-outsourcing-your-thought-leadership-responsibility-to-marketing

---

“Luk, as a Practice Lead, I oversee a team of 25 consultants across four countries. I don’t have time anymore for marketing and business development. Besides, that’s what I have my marketing team for.”

This stance stood out to me on a call I had the other day with a Regional Practice Lead of a large consultancy.

He wanted to explore the possibility of hiring me to run a workshop for consultants in his practice on how to establish and expand their reputational footprint.

I have calls like this regularly – at least 3-4 per month. And a common theme has been emerging, highlighted perfectly in this conversation I had.

Now, this Practice Lead strongly believes in the power of expertise-driven education to grow a consulting business. He used to spend at least a couple of hours each week sharing his latest experiences.

However, as he grew professionally and became a consulting leader, he found himself with less time and interest in continuing to put in as much effort.

And that’s a big no-no in my book! As your consultancy grows or you get promoted to a leadership position or expand your practice, you can’t diminish your commitment to sharing your expertise as a thought leader. That’s when you exponentially increase your leading thought output.

Consulting growth is determined by the level of domain expertise and trust you can build. Marketers can’t achieve this without significant contributions from senior consultants.

## Marketing assets vs. marketing exposure

Marketing and business development in consulting is based on two pillars: marketing assets and marketing exposure.

• Marketing assetsare the content resources: case studies, articles, webinars, testimonials, podcasts, interviews, trend research, etc.

• Marketing exposureis the strategy for promoting or distributing these assets at scale.

Successful marketing and business development strategies are based on high-quality, expertise-driven, value-adding assets that are appropriately distributed to the right audience through the proper channels.

> “Don’t create to put something — anything — out there without considering if what you’re sharing is valuable or useful to your audience”. (Felicia C. Sullivan)

“Don’t create to put something — anything — out there without considering if what you’re sharing is valuable or useful to your audience”. (Felicia C. Sullivan)

Let’s dive deeper into the two pillars of marketing and business development.

*Recommended reading:5 Reasons Consulting Leaders Are Missing the Digital Train*

### Marketing assets

You can hire the most brilliant marketers who know SEO best practices, are fluent in various marketing automation technologies, and can efficiently manage social media accounts.

But, if you are not driving their efforts by providing them with quality assets, you are setting them up for failure. And your consultancy.

Here’s the thing. Marketers are not experts in your expertise domain. Sure, they can – and should – have a decent understanding of the field. However, they didn’t spend the last 10/20/30 years specializing in that domain, working with clients, and deepening their knowledge.

They can’t possibly produce the same level of educational value that you, as a senior expert, can. Why would you want your marketing team to work with subpar assets?

Your responsibility as a consultancy leader is to produce content that communicates leading thoughts, addresses the target audience’s prototypical pain points, offers insights and solutions, identifies trends, provides fresh perspectives, inspires clients, and explains the costs or risks of inaction, etc.

Marketing assets build trust and authoritativeness. They determine whether your practice/consultancy is at the top of your prospects’ minds as the go-to experts.

60% of buyers say that a consulting firm’s expertise is the factor most likely to substantially impact the price they are willing to pay for the services.(Source: Source Global Research,Pricing: Your biggest barrier to change?)

Times have changed. Buyers are no longer interested in marketing fluff – they get bombarded by it so much that they simply block it out.

People buy from people they know, like, and trust. Brands can help to build trust, but buyers want to feel like they know the experts behind a brand. Brands don’t solve problems, experts do.

Buyers of consulting services want to get inspired by leading thinkers, not by marketing pros and clever PR executives.

As a consulting leader, you become not only the voice of your personal brand, but the voice of your consultancy/practice.

When your consultancy grows, your practice expands, or you get appointed to a leadership position – that’s not the time to drop the ball. It’s time to exponentially increase your body of work.

Leading thinkers are fearless with the development of new content. They never, ever stop.

They write original, fresh content that inspires and educates. They convey their deep levels of expertise with their ability to identify patterns, address specific pain points, predict trends, and offer practical advice.

### Marketing exposure

Once you produce an asset, it’s the marketing team’s time to shine. It’s their job to maximize the exposure of the assets to the target audience.

Your marketers should be working on:

• Polishing up your thought leadership content

• Optimizing it for target keywords

• Identifying ways to repurpose the content

• Determining the proper channels for promotions and scheduling the promos

• Creating graphics to support the content

• Measuring the reach and engagement of the content along with other metrics

• Setting up demand-capturing campaigns and funnels

• Putting together newsletters to strengthen the educational efforts

• Looking for new ways to reach the target audience

• Testing, experimenting, measuring, and adjusting campaigns based on data and client research

Marketers play an important role in ensuring the target audience understands the depth of your consultancy’s expertise.

However, marketing is their expertise domain. Not HR technologies. Not digital transformation. No investment opportunities in Asia. Not an SAP implementation. This is what YOUR expertise domain is.

Here’s what your prospects are expecting from your content:

• 51% of prospects are looking for content that explores new/different perspectives.

• 47% are interested in action-oriented content to help make more informed decisions.

(Source: grist,Value of B2B thought leadership)

To give your prospects what they want – nay, expect! – you need to provide your marketing teams with the right assets.

*Recommended reading:The Single Biggest Mistake Consultancies Make: Talking About Themselves*

## Lead by example

Empowering marketing teams to deliver strong results is a massive reason why you, as a consulting leader, must keep producing leading-thought content.

And, you must lead by example!

As a consulting owner, partner, or practice leader, you are primarily responsible for shaping the culture in your practice/consultancy.

It is up to you to set an example of how authoritative, educational content is created, promoted, and converted into domain authority and new clients.

Every consultant in your firm should learn the foundational elements of expertise-driven business development. And it is up to teach them the ropes, to share your knowledge on how to approach content, dive to the heart of the problem of the audience, etc.

Creating such a culture ensures that business development does not solely rest on your shoulders. Everyone on the team will start contributing to the business development process.

How amazing would that be!

According to grist’sValue of B2B thought leadershipsurvey:

60% of decision-makers use thought leadership content to evaluate the expertise/insight of potential advisors.

Furthermore, as the visual below from grist shows, 58% of executives are looking for content that will enable them to make better decisions, and 51% are interested in understanding best practices.

## How to align consultants’ work with the marketing team’s work

I’ve talked quite a bit in this article about why consulting leaders should continue producing thought leadership content as their responsibilities grow. I also covered the types of activities marketing teams should engage in.

So the question is then: How do you align the work of consultants and marketers?

In my experience, it’s all about creating a mutually-dependent strategy and clearly outlining commitments:

• As a consulting leader, you should commit to an X number of educational content pieces per month/week. It would be best if you were reliable. Don’t make marketing executives chase you, send you follow-up emails, and put planned campaigns on hold. You need to be a team player!

• Marketing should plan campaigns around expertise-sharing pieces. Which newsletter will feature which piece? How can you break down a larger piece of content into smaller insights that can be distributed via social media? What types of visuals would enhance the point of a piece? These are the types of questions that marketing leaders need to determine in their campaign prep.

• Work with your marketing on identifying relevant subjects. Set up a system that allows you, your consultants, and marketers to brainstorm and exchange ideas. For example, marketing can analyze comments on your posts and offer briefs on what questions/issues come up most. You and your consultants can look through your inbox every week or two and see the types of pain points/questions that are commonly brought up by clients and prospects. This way, you create a repository of content ideas.

• Marketing must set up a system to measure the impact of expertise-driven content and track engagement with it. One of the best ways for you, a senior leader or owner/partner, and your consultants to stay motivated as you produce authoritative content is to see the difference that it makes. It’s the job of your marketing team to monitor the impact of sharing your leading thinking on generating and capturing the demand for the expertise and linking it to revenue development. It is also up to the marketing team to use this data to derive insights and make adjustment suggestions to the overall strategy.

## In conclusion

If you think you’re too busy to continuously grow your reputational footprint through content that educates your audience and showcases the depth of your expertise, you need to re-evaluate your priorities as a consulting leader.

Because here’s a simple truth: your prospects will not be convinced simply by your title. Whether you are a practice lead, a consultancy owner, or a senior consultant, you are not above the need to build trust with your audience.

This can only be done by showcasing your expertise through generous knowledge sharing.

Do you deeply connect with the problem(s) of your clients/prospects, and are you able to inspire them to move from the old (problem status) to the new (problem-solved status)?

You cannot leave all marketing and business development up to the marketing team. No matter how amazing they are at what they do, if they don’t have content that they can sink their teeth into, they will always deliver subpar results.

Finally, as a consulting leader, your job is to lead! Lead other consultants by example. Show them the power of educating the target audience. Coach them on best practices. Engage with their content. Make suggestions. Help them excel at business development.

You are not an inspiring leading thinker? You are not a consulting leader (yet).

# Why Do So Many Consultancies Neglect Former and Existing Clients? That’s Where the Money Is!

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 09 August 2022

---

It is exponentially more expensive to acquire a new client than retain or upsell an existing one. This is a simple data-backed rule in sales and marketing. It makes sense. Your past and current clients know your capabilities and the types of results you can deliver, and they tell their network.

But then why do so many consulting firms put all their focus into acquiring new clients? As soon as they finish a project, that client gets dropped. Many consulting firms talk about new business and lead gen, but hardly ever about structurally maintaining their existing relationships with current and former clients.

My opinion? New business development pipelines can be slow, expensive, and unreliable compared to generating work from past and current clients. That’s the topic I’d like to dive into.Recommended reading:How to Balance Hunting and Farming for Sustainable Consulting Growth

## Past clients are your biggest asset

As you know, I advocate that consultancies pay special attention to educating their audience. Your firm’s business development model should be rooted in educating your target audience to match the purchasing habits of a modern B2B buyer.The idea is simple. As a consultancy, your greatest marketing asset is your team’s expertise. This expertise allows you to identify your target audience’s pain points and offer solutions.

You build your reputational footprint as a consultancy based on the generosity of knowledge sharing with your audience and the precise match between your content and your audience’s needs. Your firm becomes known as a visible authority in the field, making companies more likely to hire you.

> "Remind your former and existing clients that you're there and that you care. Consistently."

"Remind your former and existing clients that you're there and that you care. Consistently."

This is not a one-time event. Instead, it’s a conversation between you and your former, current, and prospective clients. Most of your clients don’t have a single issue. They’ll encounter multiple questions and setbacks as they grow and develop their business.

Imagine this scenario: one of your leads watches your incredible webinar about the importance of developing an employee experience program. They’re entirely sold and hire your firm to do it. You create a great one; they love it.

Three years pass, and guess what? The business has expanded from a regional to a multi-national company with offices worldwide. Their employee experience needs have grown and changed.

Now, if you’ve kept in touch with them, it’s a much more natural flow to secure new business. You keep them on your consultancy’s mailing list and stay in touch on LinkedIn. You ensure they know what hurdles to expect as their business grows and how to overcome them. You remain on their radar and continue to engage them with your thought leadership content.

But if you haven’t nurtured them? Then you have to hope they remember your consultancy's great work from years ago. And if they’ve stumbled across a more convenient consulting firm in the meantime, they might hire that firm instead.

You’ve lost business there, just as surely as if a lead had dropped out of your pipeline. But for some reason, most consulting firms mainly seem to focus on the latter.

If your consultancy wants to rein in more business, your firm needs to nurture existing and former clients as your business depends on it.

Just check out thisB2B revenue waterfallby Forrester.

Notice how only 25% of won business opportunities stem from new prospects (candidates). The vast majority of opportunities lie with current customers, whom you can close through renewals, upsells, and cross-sells. Isn’t it mind-boggling that your consultancy may miss out on this sea of business?

## Nurturing doesn't have to be hard

“But Luk, I just don’t have time! Between lead gen and actually doing my job, when could I develop a nurture strategy?”

Luckily for you, it’s not complicated. You have to give former and current clients the chance to hear from you regularly.

Unlock your inner teacher and never stop giving valuable lessons. Here’s how you could set up a flywheel of content and client wins.

### 1. Develop the culture of recording client work like you’re a scientist

Scientists record everything about their projects: their hypotheses, the outcomes, the methods, and the potential future work.

As a consulting leader, you should do the same and actively encourage your consultants to follow your lead. It’s a great way to study your lessons and gives your firm many content ideas for what clients might find helpful to hear. I do this all the timein my newsletter.

### 2. Share those findings with your former and existing clients, consistently

It’s not just that past clients will have new problems; the field changes, too. You’re at the cutting edge of consulting. You have insights intothe most recent trends, the latest technologies, and new findings from other projects.

Share those insights and findings with your contacts. It’s not a pushy sell because you’re not selling; you’re educating. Not sure what to say? Use these three strategies to develop compelling content:

• Think of a recent project your consultancy completed. What did you do right? How did it work? What was the effect? This kind of referenceable case study is excellent at persuading companies of your firm’s expertise.

• Take a walk down memory lane. What was something your consultants struggled with? How have you improved since then? What changed? Sharing weaknesses and demonstrating how you’ve changed is hugely compelling and humanizing.

• Look at your team. Who is a standout player? What do they do that makes them so invaluable? By putting one person’s face to your business’s name and sharing their individual strengths, you offer more insight into what makes your consultancy business unique.

### 3. Build and grow your email list

When I started The Visible Authority in early 2020, I accumulated almost 1,000 subscribers within the first 16 months. This is a highly targeted audience whom I regularly engage and share my learnings with.

I barely get any unsubscribes and my newsletter – The Authority – has a steady open rate of 40-50%! To give you some context:20.13% is the industry average.

When I first started utilizing it during my people analytics years, I didn’t even use email software as my target audience was only approximately 100 CHROs in Benelux. I was connected with 95% of them via a simple outlook email list.

Here is what I tend to share with my audience via email:

• Invites to webinars I’m hosting

• Written case studies I’ve created

• Links to my latest LinkedIn posts

• Quarterly content summaries

• Invitations to conferences and podcasts where I am speaking

The latter is an audience-educating opportunity that is worth elaborating on even further. Speaking at conferences, pre-Corona, had numerous benefits for me – generating leads on the spot through networking being only one of them.

• The learnings I shared with others, and the new knowledge I acquired from fellow speakers and attendees were compiled into key takeaways and shared with my audience of past, current, and prospective clients.

• I leveraged the depth and value of my presentations to continuously secure more speaking engagements and, unlike most other consultancies, never had to pay a cent as a sponsor. Why? Because I wasn’t selling my consultancy and its services. I was sharing my expertise, diving into the heart of the problem of my target audience.

• I added people that I met at these events to my email list, nurturing them over time.

• I met with past clients at various conferences, always inquisitive about their business, their current state of affairs, and offering my expert advice when fitting.

• I connected with the participants on LinkedIn, expanding the reach of my content.

The base for all of this had been my email strategy. And I continue to do it now through my newsletter,The Visible Authority.

*Recommended reading:Building an Email List Is Your Ultimate Trust Weapon as a Consultant*

### 4. Collect data, analyze, adjust, and repeat

Those former and existing clients will give you new stories to share. Those new stories can bring in new clients, rope in former clients, or give existing clients another reason to extend the project's scope.

That means an endless stream of revenue and work for you. Plus, as you share this content, you’ll become more visible as an authority in your field as a consulting partner.

This process does take time, but it’s time well-spent. Remember, itcostsfive times as much to gain a new client than get repeat business from an existing or former client.

## Main takeaway: Focus on your existing client relationships

New clients are always appealing. They’re sexy. I get it. But the truth is your former, and existing clients are a gold mine. Those relationships can make or break your consultancy business.

You need to foster the habit in your consultancy of structurally maintaining relationships with past and current clients to ensure repeat business.

The best way to do that is by sending a steady stream of valuable information their way. Hold nothing back – only the best insights and most relevant and valuable case studies.

The more attention and nurturing you give your existing and former clients, the more they’ll trust and rely on you for any future business needs. The more likely they will vouch for you and actively refer your consultancy to their colleagues and peers.

That’s how you (also) grow a consulting business.

# The Best Way To Grow A Consulting Firm? Educate Your Audience!

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

---

The way clients buy consulting services has changed. It’s time not just to accept it but embrace it! Forever. There is no going back.I talk to consultancies daily. I see hundreds of websites that go on a never-ending useless bragging. I see brilliant experts refusing to share their expertise as a business strategy. I see marketing specialists trying to sign up their consultancies for every possible event in search of networking opportunities.Most of the problems I witness consultancies struggle with stem from their failure to adapt to the new B2B buying world we live in. And, considering it didn’t happen overnight, I really don’t get how they missed it.So before I discuss why educating your audience is the most proper business development strategy, let’s review the extent of changes in the consulting world.

## The new B2B buyer archetype

In mypost from earlier this year,I provided a detailed explanation of consulting trends that firms should be aware of. I strongly recommend going through it to get a more in-depth understanding.It boils down to these three main topics:

• Buyers are looking for deep expertise

• The buying process has gotten more complex

• B2B buyers adopted the behavior of B2C buyers

Let’s quickly review each topic.

### Buyers are looking for deep expertise

Gone are the days when a brand name alone was enough to impress a potential client. Gone are the days when wining and dining was how you converted a prospect into a client. Gone. Bye bye.They no longer want to hear the long list of services that your consultancy has to offer. They don’t care that your firm was on the market since the dinosaurs walked the earth. B2B buyers are looking for real value. They want measurable results. They are looking for specialists with deep expertise that can deliver these results.Between 2020 and 2022, the importance of sector knowledge and expertise of consultants for buyers has changed its ranking from #12 to #3. The quality of subject matter experts has risen in importance from #15 to #2.Why is it so important? Because they are constantly under pressure to optimize their costs and maximize the ROI to stay competitive.60% of organizationsreportlacking specific specialist skills. They rely on consultancies to fill in this gap.

### The buying process has gotten more complex

Organizations are breaking down the silos between their various departments to be agile. There is significantly more collaboration and interdependency between different organizational actors than ever before.As a result, the buying process got more complex. Whether purchasing a piece of software or hiring a consultancy, this decision now impacts a larger group of people and departments. Therefore, the number of people involved in purchasing decisions has also grown.63% of buyersreportthat the pandemic had increased the number of people involved in an average purchasing decision.As a consultancy, how will you pitch and follow up with everyone involved in the decision? How can you convey to a dozen stakeholders that your consultancy is the best firm for the job?The straightforward approach of meeting people at industry events and making a pitch simply can’t accommodate the more complex buying process.

### B2B buyers adopted the behavior of B2C buyers

If you want to understand the purchasing behavior of your prospects better, think of your behavior as a consumer. When you make any significant purchase, you probably spend hours researching and comparing different products. You Google the hell out of products. You read reviews. You ask your friends and family for recommendations. You make the final decision in consultation with your spouse. And so on.That’s what B2B buyers are doing as well. They Google consultancies and individual consultants. They read their content. They ask their network for recommendations. They read case studies published by consultancies. They make their final decision in consultation with multiple stakeholders.It’s no longer about vetting cold calls from sales executives and reviewing 100-slide sales presentations. It’s about researching and using it to determine which consultancy you can trust to deliver solid results.B2B buyers got so settled in the omnichannel behavior spearheaded by B2C buyers that71% of B2B buyers arewilling to spendmore than $50,000 in a single transaction; 27% would spend $500,000 or more.Wow!

## Educating the audience should be the driver of consulting firms' business development strategy.

“Luk, it’s getting so hard to compete. New consultancies are popping up daily and buyers have more options than ever.”

I hear statements like this daily – in my Zoom conversations with large consultancies, in the emails I receive from consulting leaders, and in the conversations I have with my clients.Yes, prospects have more choices than ever when hiring a consultancy. However, the demand for consulting services is insanely high!According tostudies,60% of organizations report lacking specific specialist skills. Furthermore, 76% of organizations plan to increase the use of consultants in the next three years.There is so much demand for consulting services. You need to know how to adapt your firm's business development strategy to tap into this giant pool.Educating your audience through expertise-driven thought leadership is the only sustainable way to grow your consulting business.

Here are just a few of the benefits of this approach:

• Establishing trust. You establish your firm as an expert by creating and sharing relevant content with your audience and helping them better understand their pain points or put them in a larger context. You don’t need to say, “We are great at what we do.” Your prospects will come to that conclusion on their own by learning new information and approaches from your content.

• Increasing visibility. Do you know what content gets shared, reshared, and referred to? The truly informative one. Creating educational LinkedIn posts, blog articles, case studies, webinars, podcast episodes, etc. makes it really easy for your audience to want to engage with that content. That engagement can be by sending a link to the post to a colleague (often, someone who will also be contributing to the decision on whether or not to hire your consultancy). It can be by reaching out to you with questions and inquiries. It can be in the form of commenting on your social media post, which, in turn, expands the visibility of your post to their network. And so on.

• Generating and qualifying leads. This is the ultimate lead generation and qualification method. When you regularly educate your audience, the people who engage the most with it are the ones that find it relevant. You don’t need 1 million people to engage with your content. You need 1,000 most relevant ones. And producing content that revolves around a particular topic is how you filter out the noise and attract your ideal clients.

• Charging premium fees. 60% of buyerssaythat a consulting firm’s expertise is the factor that’s most likely to substantially impact the price they are willing to pay for the services. Educating your audience is the most powerful and convincing way to showcase your firm's deep expertise.

• Attracting top talent. The pandemic has made one thing clear: in the majority of cases. You don’t have to tie your talent pool options to those who can be physically in the office. This has opened up consultancies to the world of talent. How do you compete against other organizations in attracting top talent? Research shows that it’s not easy. 31% of consultanciesreportfinding talent as their biggest challenge right now. When your consultancy is known for its level of expertise due to the educational approach your business development takes, you, as an employer, will stand out. When your consultants share their voice and the depth of their expertise in an authentic, authoritative way, top talent is likelier to want to be a part of this type of organization.

## Why audience education is the ultimate business development driver

There are many ways to grow your business. You can purchase ads. You can hire a salesperson to cold-call prospects and bombard them with emails and follow-ups. You can sponsor events.And I’m not saying you shouldn’t do any of these ever. Well, maybe with cold calls and mind-numbing follow-ups, I am. But, by all means, put some advertising dollars behind that case study that you are particularly proud of. Boost up your visibility by sponsoring an event here and there. Treat your prospects to a fancy dinner now and then.However, make all of these strategies secondary. Please do not rely on them.None of these strategies will convince your target audience that your consultancy has the level of expertise that prospects are looking for. They can’t convince your prospects to trust your firm.Do you know what it does? Showcasing your expertise over and over again. Sharing content that’s of value, that addresses the heart of your target audience’s problems. Everything else can only temporarily amplify that.Brand recognition is no longer the primary criterion for your prospects. The level of expertise and the ability to deliver tangible results are the factors at the top of their list.Educating your audience is how you align your consultancy's business development strategy to your prospects’ purchasing behavior.

### How successful consultancies go about educating their audience

Of course, not all educational content will have the same impact. You can’t willy-nilly your way into business growth – you need a strategy, an overarching approach. I’ve noticed similarities between successful educational approaches by consultancies over the years and boiled them down to these three strategies you can pick from and get started with today:

• Shift the potential client’s thinking: By sharing your firm's expertise on a niche subject, you help bring hidden problems and patterns to the surface, inspiring your audience to shift the way they think about their fundamental or underlying challenges. The bottom line of this approach is that you give your audience something new – you don’t repeat what they already know about their problems.

• Paint the transformational picture: Create a bold vision about the transformational potential of switching to a new, different approach. Translate your firm's expertise into the confidence you give your audience about the positive possibility of a transformation. Your vision should be contagious.

• Explain the cost of inaction: Help your prospects see beyond the immediate problem and understand the long-term implications of not taking action. As experts, your consultants should be able to identify an immediate problem and place it in a larger context. Share content that takes the audience on that journey and helps them see the more significant issue that must be addressed to avoid the cost of inaction.

## Mistakes consultancies should avoid when educating their audience

Educating your audience will only work if…

…it’s done consistently. You can’t produce two pieces of educational content per year and expect a miracle. You need consistency in your efforts. Do it on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. For example, I share my newsletter every two weeks. I post tips and advice on LinkedIn almost daily. I prepare blog articles weekly. This is how you build your consultancy's reputational footprint.Create pieces that:

(1) sound like an actual person wrote them – someone with a unique style, point of view, preferences, likes, and dislikes, etc.;

(2) communicate value, be it presenting old information from a fresh angle or presenting new information in the form of analysis, prediction of trends, approaches, etc..…it’s authentic and genuinely informative.

If you’re sharing general-type of content that barely scratches the surface of a subject, don’t even bother. It’s a waste of your time. Thousands of articles like that get published daily by consulting firms' marketers. Your prospects are drowning in this type of content.…it caters to a very niche audience. Focus, focus, focus. That’s what it comes down to. And I’m not talking about every article being overly in-depth. I’m referring to consistently educating your audience on a minimal range of themes that fall into a niche subject. If your consultancy addresses too many expertise domains, your audience becomes unclear. You fail to establish your firm as a specialist. You fail to build visibility in a specific niche.…it shares knowledge generously. I’ve seen many case studies where a consultancy provides details on the client’s problem, then goes on and on about their results. The middle part – the HOW – gets mentioned very briefly. Yet it’s the HOW that your prospects want to know. Here’s the thing, though. The more generous you are with your knowledge, the more trust you build with your audience, and the more willing they will be to hire your firm and pay premium fees. “If this consultancy shares this much knowledge freely, imagine what they can do if I hire them” – this is what you want your prospects to think.

## I did not have to sell a single day of my life to grow my business

I never had to sell my services. Not ever. I started and successfully grew two companies, selling one of them to one of the largest consultancies in the world – Deloitte. While running a boutique consultancy, I got projects that large consultancies were competing against each other to get.Why? Was it because I am the one and only true expert? I’m sure there were plenty of brilliant people I was competing against. But I put the time and effort into building my reputational footprint. I didn’t put together fancy slide decks. I focused on proving my expertise by sharing my knowledge.It wasn’t always easy to produce valuable content. Not every swing was a hit. But it never felt like an uphill battle to me, and sharing my expertise has enabled me to create opportunities I would not have had otherwise.Instead of developing short-lived content to tell potential clients how great we were (which would have been a darn uphill battle), I always focused on sharing deep experience and knowledge. The teacher in me kept asking:

• What did I learn in the project trenches about the biggest client pains that others could learn from?

• Which experiences did I acquire that could be valuable for others?

• What were the unique client stories (with successes and struggles) that could inspire others to pursue better outcomes?

This resulted in prestigious conferences inviting me as their keynote speaker. This resulted in Google’s algorithm picking up my content as it ranked highly for authoritativeness and trust. It resulted in prospects reading my case studies, learning exactly how I approach projects, and reaching out to me. The list of benefits goes on.

I was able to exponentially grow my business and charge premium fees on the back of my content. The expertise it conveyed allowed me to position myself in the advisory/diagnostic role. I didn’t need to take on tedious implementation projects. I worked directly with C-level executives, offering upstream services.Although I never started developing content for monetization purposes, I could quickly draw a correlation line between the content volume available, my visibility improvement, and the growth of the consulting business.The content gave access to more clients and a consistent flow of new client leads. I never had to chase new clients. Clients came to my consultancy instead of us having to convince and sell. Inbound instead of outbound. And, by the way, aggressive revenue growth targets (especially after the Deloitte acquisition) were always achieved with zero marketing!

## In conclusion

I wrote quite a bit about B2B buying behavior changes, the importance of educating your audience, and my personal experience.If there is one thing I want you to take away, it’s this: aggressively pursuing prospects with outdated sales strategies is a recipe for a business disaster.

The only way to drive business growth is to align your firm's business development strategy to your prospects’ behavior and needs. This is not a new business rule that I invented. This principle has been around for decades. So stop to think about whether your consultancy’s business development approach matches the market's reality.

# With Improper Diversification, Consulting Firms Are at Risk to Fail

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 12 July 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/with-improper-diversification-consulting-firms-are-at-risk-to-fail

---

Most consulting firms keep adding new services because they believe more services will lead to more opportunities and revenue.Unfortunately, more services mean more competition, more price erosion, smaller margins, thinner expertise, poorer thought leadership, less time to get visible, more hiring challenges, more training hours, more client gatekeepers to deal with, and more objections from more stakeholders, and probably 100 more fallouts.

## Yet another service. But why?

To say it politely, I am not a big fan of broad and sometimes irrational diversity in consulting. We were able to grow a consulting firm year after year for a decade with only one very focused expertise domain. We always stayed in our lane and were well known for it in our markets—a thrill.I don’t know why so many consulting firms are adding service after service.

> As a professional services firm, the only product you have to sell—and what potential clients need to be persuaded to buy—is your collective expertise. In our recent study on buyer behavior, we found that across professional services, expertise was the most common selection criteria next to talented staff. (Hinge Marketing)

In our recent study on buyer behavior, we found that across professional services, expertise was the most common selection criteria next to talented staff. (Hinge Marketing)

Just finished a new project with a client? Let’s use that project to create (yet) another new service! Did you hire a new partner or leader with yet another expertise? Let’s give him/her a new service line. Honestly, I don’t get that. Why the heck would you hire another expertise at all? When I ask them, many consulting leaders tell me: “We are diversifying to protect us from economic risk”. OK, I get that.

Unfortunately, I am a big disbeliever - yes, big - in such so-called (fear-based) economic protection-driven diversification. Smart focus and specialization are a much better protection as long as you carefully monitor the new trends and finetune when/where necessary. That works way, way better. And it is easier to manage and market.And it is much more profitable! Yes!Last week, I had to check out a midsized consulting firm in preparation for a positioning audit. On their homepage: “We are consulting at the intersection of strategy, organization, data, and AI”. This is an actual tagline! How the heck can you acquire AND maintain all those expertise domains under one roof?Even if it would make sense, such a combination is the ultimate erosion of what consulting is all about: building and growing deep trust in a specific expertise domain. How can consulting firms be credible with a list of totally unconnected expertise domains? Anyway, it's probable me.

*Recommended reading:To Succeed As A Consultancy, Get Rid Of The Scarcity Mindset*

## Diversification is more challenging to manage

Many of the diversified consulting firms are telling me the ‘risk protection story’ because they weren’t able to focus or weren’t able to agree on the direction amongst the leaders, heck.

A lot of the diversification hassle in consulting firms is just a negligent legacy problem of having added and added (and added) services in the past because the leaders believed they could make more money with more services.But what those leaders don’t realize is the increasing difficulty of managing such a consultancy from every possible angle. And that gets translated straight into (very) deep margin erosion.

> There’s a lot of ‘legacy dept’ in big consulting firms, a too long list of services and expertise verticals that were added to the portfolio in the past and have become difficult to maintain. (Quoting a partner from a Big 4 consulting firm)

There’s a lot of ‘legacy dept’ in big consulting firms, a too long list of services and expertise verticals that were added to the portfolio in the past and have become difficult to maintain. (Quoting a partner from a Big 4 consulting firm)

Two expertise clusters? Well, that’s like growing two consulting firms: building the processes, the methodologies, developing the marketing and business development, the hiring of the people, the training, the client management, and so on. Everything is double (or more).Shortsighted diversification is a leaking margin bucket. In my experience with my clients, it takes 2 to 3 years to achieve robust margins after adding a new service line or expertise domain.I sometimes get a little provocative when discussing with consulting leaders. I tell them: "Show me a consultancy P&L, and without knowing anything about that consulting firm, I am almost 100% sure I can ‘smell’ it’s either a focused or an unfocused/diversified consulting firm".In almost 90% of the cases, heavy diversification pulls consulting firms into a downstream rate game because they compete on nearly everything and rarely have power in selling as experts. Lower income, higher costs, inefficient marketing, and utilization challenges. What else?

> Over time, your service offerings just get really, really complex, and it gets disastrous. I think every once in a while, you've got to step back and say, "Okay, folks, let's start over here. What do we really want to do for clients?" (David C. Baker)

## The patterns of inefficient diversification

When I audit such diversified consulting firms, here are some returning patterns. Yes, they almost always return.

• Strong inside view: The mindset is on the inward view of ‘here’s what WE do’ instead of the outward, client-centric view of ‘here’s what can be achieved’. They always seem to be in the let's-tell-our-clients-how-great-we-are mode. The diversification makes it very difficult to talk about specific expertise and even more challenging to talk about the value they can add or the impact they can have. That’s why they get into the dull (because everybody is saying the same stuff) ‘here’s what we do’ selling.

• Service orientation: The inside view almost automatically leads to a dominant service orientation vs. an expertise-driven problem resolution. These firms lead with their laundry list of services and, unfortunately, not (enough) with their expertise. Services are a means to an end. The starting point is problem-resolution expertise.

• Downstream: Linked to the strong service orientation, these consulting firms are more often pulled towards downstream work, output & activity-driven vs. outcome/result-driven. Clients are more often in the lead, and arduous pitching and dealing with the procurement gatekeepers is the everyday life of the downstream (highly diverse) consulting firm.

• Rate game: Because of output/service focus, these consulting firms have a much stronger 'billing-by-the-hour/day’ project profile (because they have no authority in a specific expertise domain). As a result, most of them are stuck in the toxic rate game;

• Fear-based:Often with a tendency or risk to over-serve & under-charge to please the client (with a lot of service scope creep) or out of fear of losing the client (because the diversified consulting firm is easier to replace);

• Hitting the project wall:Lower average revenue per project, more projects needed to achieve volume, causing permanent lead-gen stress;

• Capacity stress:High volume of ‘smaller projects’ is always causing capacity and hiring challenges. Not a good time right now (hiring difficulties);

• Underperforming content:Most consulting firms understand the importance of thought leadership to demonstrate expertise. But if expertise is heavily diverse (or all over the place), this content will always be underperforming. It's not generating demand nor building trust (I hardly ever see the pain-dream-fix-educate chain because of the diversification);

• Outbound:Business development is outbound-driven, less reliable, has heavy ups & downs, is costly & inefficient (lot of work, little result);

• The Google mirror:Poor signal relevancy in Google, not strong in prototypical keywords linked to the expertise, not connected to the value proposition (Google is an excellent client mirror);

• Absent leaders:The leader's voice is not visible because these leaders are all over the place. They are stuck in their everyday hamster wheel;

• Poor margins:Much, much lower margins (between 20-50%!) because of inefficient work (covering multiple subjects), substantially higher hiring and training costs, and more struggle with retention (because everybody feels the pressure and the inefficient way of working). Have a look again at the introduction of this article, all the extra costs are listed.

## Create small pockets of overarching expertise domains

I assume my Sunday evening sketch below (fig. 1) is self-explanatory. The message: get rid of the red and orange clusters. They don’t fit together. Naturally, they cover multiple audiences and multiple expertise dimensions.Consider it like this (that has always helped my focus-thinking): focusing on a focused expertise cluster (green color)will most likely lower the typical client resistance for consultants.

In all other cases (orange and red), consultancies will increase resistance, meaning they will have to market, pitch, propose, sell, persuade, and negotiate much more. The result: more costs, less profit. And sleepless nights. Been there (and will never go back).About the red cluster: there’s no specific audience (total market). It has a broad service menu (‘we work at the intersection…’) in multiple expertise domains. This would be my nightmare consulting firm. I am talking a lot to these one-stop-shop, full-service, end-to-end consulting firms (mainly in the digital space). They are all in the red cluster, battling the toxic rate game because they compete on almost everything with everybody. More services, more income? Forget it. There's no direct correlation.Unless these firms would be able to…

• mirror a specific client life cycle with their end-to-end or one-stop-shop services (a specific service for a specific moment in the life cycle, which I doubt is possible) or…

• make most clients use the majority (>70%) of ALL the services, ALL the time. In that particular case, I’d say congratulations. It would be a rare case of a more profitable, easier-to-manage diverse consulting firm.

Fig. 1: Pockets of expertise

## Lead with expertise. Grow vertically.

OK, I am sure not everybody will agree with my point of view. But…I am considering consulting business growth from a few very specific perspectives, and I am sure you will all love them:

• Consistently invest in marketing (creating demand at the expertise level) & business development (capturing the demand for the problem-resolution expertise);

• Improve the depth of expertise (repetition of work & pattern recognition) to vertically grow with new and improved knowledge;

• Educating the audience to build trust (or lower the typical resistance for consultants) in problem-resolution expertise, becoming the go-to experts with inspiring case studies, thinking shifts, referenceable clients, and leading thoughts;

• Staying away from the (downstream) rate game, always striving for (upstream) premium pricing, adequately covering for forceful marketing and biz dev efforts;

• Making sure that the premium pricing supports upmarket margins, avoiding having to (horizontally) move to the next shiny service to earn money.

*Recommended reading:Lead with your expertise, not with your consulting services*

### Are you keen to grow your expertise-driven consulting firm or practice? Think vertically first!

Have a look at the sketch below. Growth is at these two levels:

• at the level of the client's pain points. Discover their new challenges, latest bottlenecks, or recent events they have to deal with;

• at the level of the value proposition: your process, your solutions, your methodologies, your technology, etc. to deal with their new challenges.

Don’t grow first at the overarching expertise domain level (meaning, creating another expertise domain or service line). You will have to repeat everything in the new domain. I'm fine with it if that’s a credible move (with low client resistance). But don’t forget, it’ll take you 2-3 years to get back - hopefully - to the old margin levels (before the diversification), if at all.And please, don’t underestimate the impact of the current hiring challenges on the labor market (pretty much everywhere on the globe). If consultancies grow horizontally by adding new services in diverse expertise domains, they will need to hire and train new people with new expertise all the time. And that’s a very big, costly, and risky challenge.Growing vertically is much easier from a capacity-building point of view. I’ve been there.

Fig. 2: Growing vertically in the expertise domain

## Grow at the level of the client’s pain points or the value proposition

And yes, that’s why narrow focus and consistent repetition of projects are so important! With repeated observation (due to the narrow focus), the consultancy will continuously learn more about the client's pains, challenges, and bottlenecks.A better/deeper understanding of the clients will provide new opportunities for problem-solving approaches, methodologies, and maybe even new technologies. That’s how consulting firms can grow in an expertise-driven way.

The example of my (people analytics) consulting firm in the past decade

• Projects:We started with doing (smaller) analytical projects;

• Building the function:By doing these analytical projects, we learned that HR leaders were struggling to develop the analytical function and internal capabilities. That was our next (vertical) growth opportunity: helping them to build the function/capabilities;

• Data-driven decision-making:In the next phase, we learned that data-driven decision-making in the broader HR team/community was a problem. We started training & transforming HR departments (helping them to become more data-driven in their decision-making). It was our next-generation opportunity, with a (much) larger scope;

• Integrating into processes:In the next phase, we learned that success in data-driven HR could only be achieved through embedding/integrating analytical approaches in the core HR processes (e.g. hiring processes, performance management, talent development, etc.). That was a new consulting opportunity and again with larger scope;

• Employee Experience:Ultimately, we learned that the employee journey (with the so-called ‘moments of truth’) would be the very best way to connect the data and analytics (analyzing the employee experience). Another additional level of (vertical) expertise development and scope enlargement.

So, as you can see, over a period of almost a decade, we evolved from simple analytical projects to complex, high-ticket, upstream analytical consulting projects without leaving our overarching expertise domain. Vertical growth is king. Clients loved it. Horizontal growth (diversification with new expertise domains) is hell. Sorry. Yes, it's me.

> The 'Performance Envelope' is the zone where the firm does its best work (i.e. profitable work). This zone is recognized as the firm’s core business and drives the firm’s profitability, recruitment and training efforts, rewards structure, and brand. Regrettably, these cores are unstable and are under constant external pressure from competitor encroachment, competitive innovation, pricing pressure, and commoditization. (Jeff McKay & David Kuhlman)

(Jeff McKay & David Kuhlman)

## My final advice

Your consulting firm is highly diverse? You might leave a lot of money on the table. Cut back, reduce, refocus, simplify, and create better (interrelated) pockets of overarching expertise domains for a reduced number of target audiences.

Ask yourself: is the service diversification credible in the eyes of the client? Or the reversed question: did we reduce enough client resistance with our current expertise and reputation?

I am convinced there's no long-term risk with a narrowly (vertically integrated) focused consulting firm if you can keep a sharp eye on market trends. Forget the fairy tale about economic risk protection. That’s plain BS if, eventually, you'd constantly monitor and finetune your narrow positioning in the marketplace.

I can guarantee you: the consultancy management will become way more efficient and, as a result, the margins will substantially improve. And as a leader, you might be better protected against burnout. Seriously.

Running a diversified consulting firm would be my utter nightmare. Focus is heaven.

# To Succeed As A Consultancy, Get Rid Of The Scarcity Mindset

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 13 June 2022

---

I recently worked with a consultancy that couldn’t figure out what they were doing wrong. They could handle pretty much any client request in the book, no matter the industry. They had a very high utilization maximization – no benchwarmers on the team.And with every new project successfully completed, they were able to add a new expertise to their roster that they could sell to the next client, making them more competitive. On paper, they felt like they were doing great.Yet they found themselves struggling, hitting the so called ‘the project wall’: doing all sorts of small projects at low rates and with a huge business development pressure. Having to sell such small projects again and again, made them very vulnerable to big ups and downs without reliable revenue development.

*Recommended reading:Getting Over 'The Project Wall' To Grow A Consultancy FirmThey hired me to audit their business development approach. As soon as I started auditing, I noticed several potential issues. But most of all, their inconsistent pipeline made them feel they had to say yes to every new small opportunity – even if it wasn’t a great fit. And worst of all, they were insecure about their true reputation because they couldn’t figure out their ideal target audience. They had a lot of internal debate on this, a tough situation for everybody in the leadership team.Without going into all the details of the audit, I’d like to talk about the subject of focus in this article. Yes, the lacking focus of this consulting firm. Jumping around from (small) project to project, with an almost impossible variety to deal with.*

Somehow, they knew the truth. But still, it was hard for them to hear what I shared with them: their fear of missing revenue was causing them to actually lose business in the long run. In their desire to win every potential client, they were setting themselves up to fail.What this firm needed to do instead was drop the scarcity mindset and embrace narrowing its focus.

## Don’t be an a la carte consultancy - control the conversation with clients

The consultancy I was working with had a terrible habit of asking the client what they needed and then making that happen no matter what. Part of the reason behind that was the revenue pressure I mentioned earlier – they were terrified of turning a single client away. But another issue was that there was a lot of ego present in these conversations. When a prospect or a client asked, “Can you really do this for me?” a partner of the consultancy would jump in to say, “Yes, absolutely we can.”That ego was a mask for the low confidence the consultancy leaders actually felt. If you don’t have a clear view of your own positioning (aka a clear definition of the target audience with a prototypical problem your consultancy can solve), it’s a lot easier to let the client decide what they need. That way there’s no risk of losing business.

*Recommended reading:14 Symptoms of a Poorly Positioned Consultancy*

However, as a consultancy, you should be the expert voice in the room. Don’t allow yourself to be led by the client – you’re here to tell them what to do, not the other way around.If you’re still letting clients steer the conversation, you’re selling yourself short. They’ve hired you because, ostensibly, you’re the best at what you do. By allowing clients to tell you what they need, you get stuck only offering low-revenue services. You want to provide high-priced expertise. You can’t do that if you’re providing any and all services for your clients.An a la carte consultancy is a one-way ticket to low and inconsistent revenue. But it’s also a trap in other ways. By offering up every service to clients, you struggle to develop deep authority in a field. You become a jack of all trades, master of none.Every project you perform is nothing but customized work, whatever the client thinks they need from you. There is no repeatability of project types. On every new project, your team members might be working on something totally different from last time. It’s a very inefficient way to work.While this scattershot approach will broaden your expertise, it won’t deepen it. Broad expertise is cheap. Deep expertise is where you can charge what your consultancy is truly worth.

## Your scarcity mindset is warping your perspective

The reason so many consultancies struggle to own their lane is thanks to that scarcity mindset. They’re afraid to lose out on potential business, so they commit to doing whatever it takes to gain that new client and keep them happy. But it’s not only perfectly OK, it’s actually necessary to say no to bad opportunities if you want to grow your consultancy.I’ll get it out of the way: in the short term, saying no to some of your opportunities will mean you miss out on revenue. When you truly are ready to make the shift, you’ll look at your pipeline and see lots of opportunities that aren’t actually a great fit for your niche. You will have to lose potential business.But by only saying yes to opportunities that really fit in your lane, you’ll gain the chance to deepen your authority level with every client you work with. And the more of an authority you are, the more clients you’ll attract in the future.Too many consultancies see ill-suited opportunities as a chance to increase revenue for their consultancy. Instead, start viewing them as what they truly are: a cost on your future growth potential. Every time you say no to something that’s not in your true field of expertise, you gain an opportunity to strengthen your authority in that field, which leads to more clients and higher revenue down the line.

## Enter the glorious loop of consultancy heaven

Here’s the loop many consultancies find themselves stuck in: You don’t have the necessary confidence to own your niche, so you try to do everything for a client. The problem with trying to do everything is that you’re then competing with every other consultancy out there. You’re never going to beat everyone else on expertise because you’re spread too thin. So instead you have to offer competitive pricing. Your competitive pricing makes your revenue drop precipitously. Now to make your targets, you need to say yes to every potential opportunity even if it’s not a great fit for your expertise. And we’re back at the beginning.

*Recommended reading:There Are Two Ways Of Doing Consulting, One Is Toxic*

It’s a race to the bottom. And it’s too easy for your consultancy to get stuck in this downward spiral, what I call the consulting vicious loop to hell. What you should aim for instead is getting into the glorious loop to heaven.Imagine this: Every opportunity you say yes to is something you’re an expert at. Every project deepens your expertise. The deeper your expertise, the better your positioning as a consultancy. The better your positioning, the more you’re able to charge for that expertise. The more you charge, the more exclusive you can be with opportunities that truly fit your expertise, which further deepens your experience. That positive loop is how you become the most visible authority in your field.To ensure you’re only saying yes to the right opportunities, you need to nip your loop at the source. Find the necessary conviction in your niche and commit to saying no to projects that don’t fit that niche. Don’t be afraid to miss out on business. Instead, discover the confidence to wait for your ideal client, trusting that they’re out there and your consultancy is uniquely qualified to help them. Let go of the scarcity mindset and embrace your focus.It will be hard because your consultancy is used to saying yes to every potential revenue opportunity. But it’s a necessary exercise to deepen your authority and become more visible in your field.That’s the only way to truly succeed as a consultancy.

# Business Development In Consulting Is Rooted In Educating Your Audience

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

Business development in consulting will never be the same anymore.

Why is that? Here are 6 reasons you need to understand.

• Buyers do deep research:buyers of consulting services do their homework before getting in touch. Research says that 70-80% of the decision-making is done BEFORE contacting the consultancy. Buyers have access to an abundance of information that empowers them to navigate most of the buying process independently;

• The social era:we are in the age where buyers discover & evaluate consulting services through their NETWORK: analyst reviews, social media, word of mouth, content platforms, Slack or WhatsApp groups, etc. Consultants that haven’t taken care of their expertise-rich social profile? They are in trouble!

• Expertise & problem research:buyers do research at the level of specific expertise linked to THEIR SPECIFIC PROBLEM, not at the level of your services or the level of your incomprehensible consulting language;

• Increased speed:the Pandemic has increased the speed of the hiring of experts, buyers have little patience, and they have a very short, 3 to max. 12 months horizon (says research);

• B2C behaviors:buyers have developed B2C behaviors: they are looking for easy-to-find educational information, ‘trust stuff’ linked to their problem(s), they want ‘connecting with a click’ (and if you don’t build that ‘easy-to-contact’, your competitor will do);

• Trust significance:due to the growing business complexity (a lot of new pillar topics such as supply chain, cyber security, hybrid work, and many more) and the speed of all these changes, the trust importance has gone up 70% (says research). You won't be at the party without your leading 'trust stuff' (consistently sharing your leading thoughts).

Demand for consulting in organizations has grown and will continue to grow (says research) due to increasing complexity combined with missing internal expertise. But supply has also grown tremendously.

So, the next chapter explains how you can get invited to the buyer's party.

## How to get included in the buyer’s homework?

• Lead with expertise.Instead of a service laundry list, you will need to lead with problem-resolution expertise (that’s where the buyer’s research gets done).Read my articleabout the service delusion in the consulting industry.

• Educate.Your business development will have to be rooted in educating your (laser-sharp defined) audience.

### Here’s how you educate your audience

• Nurture consistently.Educate your target audience about their prototypical pain points, consistently nurturing them with cases, successes and struggles from projects, interviews with similar clients, the latest industry trends, new technology opportunities, sharing thoughts and advice from other leading thinkers, etc.;

• Shift your audience’s thinking.Help them bring hidden problems and patterns to the surface and inspire your audience to shift the way they think about their fundamental or underlying challenges. Your audience doesn’t want to hear what they already know about their problems;

• Create a bold and contagious vision.A vision about the transformational potential of switching from ‘old to new’, to a different approach. Translate your expertise into the confidence that you can give to your audience about the positive potential of a transformation, picture them ‘the promised land’;

• Explain risks & opportunities.Make them aware of the risks and the costs of inaction or status quo. With your expertise, you are on the first row to explain risks and opportunities;

• Process clarification.Explain the process of how they can get from ‘old to new’ and how they can do a successful transformation home run.

*Recommended reading:Why You Should Share Your Expertise To Grow Your Consulting Business*

## My final message to you in consulting

Lead your business development with your expert voice. Research confirms that 90% of your audience is prepared to pay more for deep, robust expertise linked to their pressing problems. That's a unique opportunity for all of you to grow your consulting business. What are you waiting for?

Solo consultant, a boutique consultancy, or a big consulting firm? It doesn’t matter. It’s the buyer, stupid.

# The Biggest Consulting Misconception Is Holding You Back From Limitless Growth

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers

**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/the-biggest-consulting-misconception-is-holding-you-back-from-limitless-growth

---

I was drinking my morning coffee when I saw a LinkedIn post from a fellow consultant on my feed. It started off strong. She opened with a gripping introduction about some bagel company that had hired her consultancy team and how they’d helped analyze its strengths and weaknesses.

She shared the final (and remarkable) result that her team’s analysis had on the bagel company’s bottom line. It was a great story.

I was impressed. But I was also curious. Throughout the post, she didn’t ever sharehowshe did this. Her consultancy acted as a black box.

Curious, I reached out to her. I let her know I enjoyed her post but would love to hear more about how her team accomplished this. She sent me a long, detailed message explaining exactly how they did it, with specific details and incredible insights. The information in that message was priceless.

Then I asked her, hopefully without sounding rude: “Why didn’t you include those details in your post?”

Her answer surprised me: “Don’t give away the cow if you want to sell the milk!”

This attitude is so prevalent among consultants. Help! But it’s actively holding them back from proper limitless growth. Let me tell you why.

## You Aren’t Being Hired Because of Your Secret Strategies

Think about some common “secrets” in your work as a consultant or expert. I am sure you can think of a few off the top of your head.But let me tell you, I am 100% sure none of them are secrets. Consultants who successfully use such secrets aren’t successful because they know them. Their success comes from implementing them well.

Consulting clients don’t hire you or your team because they think you have a proprietary blueprint that will solve all their problems. Ask yourself this: if you told a client exactly what your process is and what they needed to do, with step-by-step instructions, would they be able to do it as effectively as you, the expert?Would they be able to do it at all? The answer is probably no. Honestly, most of what you do as a consultant isn’t a secret at all. Others have been doing similar/same things thousand times before. Million times. Heck. Don't fool yourself.

Even if you don’t recognize this, your clients do. They hire you because they believe you’re the best expert or the best expert team for the job. They think that you uniquely understand their business and their problems. They believe you will be able to enact the same strategies everyone uses to the best effect possible for them.

*Recommended reading:Lead with your expertise, not with your consulting services*

Those companies will be way more likely to hire you if you freely offer proof that you know what you’re talking about. Prospective clients can tell when you’re holding nothing back. This makes them trust you more.

I could sum up the entire article in those two sentences.

> I’m always amazed by how many consultants fall into the scarcity mindset trap that holds them back from sharing.

## Share your 'secret sauce' to boost your online visibility

Ask yourself this: what piece of content will build more trust for your expertise on LinkedIn? A vague celebratory post about your recent 'weekend-in-the-forest' with the consulting team? Or a detailed case study sharing exactly what you did and, most importantly, what the results were, and the impact you had?

I can tell you from experience that not only does the latter get more eyeballs, but the people who see it are far more likely to contact you in the long run.In this age of social media, online visibility matters. But it’s more than just posting every day on the right networks. It’s about using those channels to build trust and portray yourself as a true authority in the field.Use any of these simple content ideas to improve your business’s growth:

• Think of a recent project.What did you do right? How did it work? What was the effect? This kind of referenceable case study is excellent at persuading companies of your expertise.

• Take a walk down memory lane.What was something you struggled with? How have you improved since then? What changed? You obviously don’t want to share your latest struggles, but sharing older weaknesses and demonstrating how you’ve changed is hugely compelling and humanizing.

• Look at your team.Who is a standout player? What do they do that makes them so invaluable? By putting one person’s face to your business’s name and sharing their individual strengths, you offer more insight into what makes your consultancy business unique.

*Recommended reading:Business Development In Consulting Is Rooted In Educating Your Audience*

I've also published my latest thoughts on the topic of 'sharing your expertise' on Linkedin. Here are those posts:

• "Luk, I don't have time to educate my audience".

• Struggling with developing your leading thoughts in your consultancy?

• 99% of consultants have nothing to say.

• Business development in consulting is (rather) easy.

• I've built a consulting business on the back of a blog.

• Key voices are absent in most consulting firms.

If you’re scared of sharing what goes on behind the curtain, you’re limiting your consulting growth unnecessarily. When you are open and unafraid to explain how you do what you do, you’ll quickly see the results as your consulting business will create new growth opportunities.

# We Live in the Era of the 'Leveraged Consultant'

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 09 May 2022

---

We live in the era of the ‘leveraged individual’. Inspiring experts have more views than news channels. And consulting doesn’t get it (yet).Buying professional services will never be the same anymore. The next digital generation will be buying consultancy services dramatically differently. And we are still early days.

The best business development in consulting will not look like business development.

In this article, I'd like to discuss the 'leveraged consultant' - what this archetype entails and why we are entering the era of the leveraged consultant.

## Business development in consulting has irreversibly changed

To understand who 'leveraged consultants' are and why they will prevail, we first need to review the new business climate we live in.

Before the pandemic, business development in consulting was already changing: more digital focus and less old-school ‘wining & dining’ to win new business. Research confirms that the fastest-growing consultancies are also the savviest adopters of digital marketing and business development.Why has business development changed? Because the way buyers buy has fundamentally changed. And Corona has cemented these buying behaviors forever.

• Buyers do deep research: buyers of consulting services do their homework before getting in touch. Research confirms that 70-90% of the decision-making is done BEFORE contacting the consulting firm. Buyers have access to an abundance of free information that empowers them to independently navigate most of the buying process. Gristresearchfound that60% of decision-makers use thought leadership content to evaluate the expertise/insight of potential advisors.

• The social era: We're in the age where buyers discover & evaluate consulting services through their NETWORK: analyst reviews, social media, word of mouth, content platforms, etc. Consultants that haven’t taken care of their expertise-rich social profile? They will get in trouble!

In the professional services industry, the traditional, non-leveraged business development models - relationship-driven & selling from within (legitimate and necessary, of course) - are getting in trouble. The old strategies and techniques won't cut it anymore. An additional digital-fueled, leveraged approach will be crucial for success. There’s no way back. And we are still early days.

## Who is the 'leveraged consultant'?

The leveraged consultant creates an essential volume of organic demand for the consultancy by educating the target audience in the market at scale.In the new consulting world, you no longer have a choice: you will need to develop and share the best possible educational content consistently. If you don’t, you’ll belong to the loser's camp sooner or later. Seriously.Solo consultant, a boutique consultancy, or a big consultancy firm? There’s no difference! It’s the buyer, heck!The best business development in consulting will not look like business development. Business development with the ‘leveraged consultant’ will occur in WhatsApp groups, peer communities, professional networks, slack groups, review platforms, social media, micro-learning platforms, etc.The ‘leveraged consultants’ will be multi-platform educators.With the leveraged approach in consulting, you'd end up with a much different way of doing business development, a much different way to measure results, a much different set of team routines, and a much different set of hiring profiles that you would bring to the team (multi-platform educators).

### An amazing case study to study and follow

Since its start in late 2019, a few months before the first lockdown, I’ve been following B2B marketing consultancy ‘Refine Labs’ and its CEOChris Walker(no, he’s not my client).

Without going into all the details, here are a few remarkable facts:

• Consulting start: September 2019 (with a slow down in the early lockdown period)

• Revenue development: from zero to $40 million in 2,5 years!

• Team: from zero to 110 people in 2,5 years!

• The leveraged consulting firm: close to 300educational podcast episodes(a top 10 B2B podcast in the US), weekly open Q&A sessions (with impressive participation), bi-weekly webinars, and monthly open conferences. All free!

• The leadership team is a ‘leveraged team’. They have their own successfuleducational podcast. They are all prototypical ‘leveraged consulting leaders’, multi-platform educators;

• Chris Walker, the CEO, is on Linkedin every day (it’s his morning routine) with incredible content via text AND video. On top, he runs his excellent weekly podcast (for which he creates the content). He has just under 100k followers on Linkedin, starting from scratch, of course, in 2019.

• Chris’s priority as CEO? Chris: “Educating my target audience and, by doing so, creating the demand for my consulting firm”. (remember, from zero to $40M in 2,5 years).

You need to check him out. This kind of 'leveraged consulting firm' is a new reality. A leveraged consulting firm can start from scratch and have 40M revenue and a team of 110 in a flabbergasting short period (2,5 years only). Wow!

### My take away from Chris’ story

This rapid consulting growth will happen more in the future because examples like Chris Walker will be an inspiration for other consulting firms. It would be best to reflect on that as a leader, owner, or partner in a consulting firm. A clever, digitally fueled expert can pop up all of a sudden and blow your consulting firm away with Chris's leveraged approach. And nobody is coming to rescue you.

The leveraged consulting firm or consultant? Still, a long way to go. The good news is you can start building it tomorrow. It’s not complicated. But it requires courage, tremendous discipline, new routines, and a strong belief that it can be done. Chris did it.To all consulting leaders: become a ‘leveraged individual’ like Chris!

# 14 Symptoms of a Poorly Positioned Consultancy

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 25 March 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/14-symptoms-of-a-poorly-positioned-consultancy

---

Earlier this year, I gave a workshop to a mid-sized consulting firm. One of the sessions was about ‘symptoms of a poorly positioned consultancy’. As it is such an important topic, I wanted to share what these symptoms are with my readers.Most consultancies I meet don’t end up where they had hoped. Their reputational footprint or authority is not strong enough, they struggle to build a healthy pipeline, they aren’t working with the type of clients they envisioned, and - the most difficult challenge of all - the leaders/owners have a lot of internal debate about the vision and direction.What I experience is that - in most cases - those mid-sized consultancies played the generalist (laundry list of services), inward-looking (talking about themselves all the time instead of about the client’s prototypical problems) game for way too long. That may have worked 5 years ago, but it is almost old-school today. Many new, extremely specialized consultancy firms have started in the past years, and they are hitting the ground running. It’s a losing battle in our arduous consulting space.

*Recommended reading:Your Consulting Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying DecisionWhen I review the generalist, inward-looking consultancy, the symptoms quickly get on the table. It’s not a difficult exercise after all, and, strangely enough, the partners/owners are pretty aware of these symptoms but unable to get rid of them.*

## Symptoms of a poorly positioned consultancy

Having worked with dozens of consultancies and spoken to 200+ consultants in the past 2 years, I’ve developed a list of the most important symptoms  of poor positioning. Here you go.

• New leads: receiving few spontaneous invitations and requests for expertise, poor overall visible in the market/industry,see also my LinkedIn post;

• Proposals: writing (extended) customized proposals all the time (due to saying yes to almost everything), a stressful and time-consuming activity;

• Win rates: suffering from low win rates and not knowing why pitches get lost (reputed consultancies have >70% win rates), mainly looking at the competition instead of doing introspection (not created enough trust with the prospect,see my LinkedIn post);

• Briefings: plain acceptance of project briefings of the prospect, being afraid to give candid pushback because of 1) not having enough expertise depth and 2) being afraid to lose the prospect;

• Objections: struggling with strenuous client objections (not specializing results in not deeply knowing all the possible objections) and the inability to answer the ugly question ‘why should we hire your consultancy?’ (and if they get that question, they already lost the game);

• Saying No: hardly ever saying NO because of keeping all options open to protect revenue;

• Narrative: constantly twisting the expertise narrative to ease the pitch (resulting in quickly leaving the internally agreed expertise lane, this is a big struggle between owners/partners all the time)

• Rates: getting requested to share rates & costs, even before the pitch (this is a form of disbelieve and/or lack of trust in the expertise);

• Discounts: allowing serious discounts to please the prospect/client, client payments are slow, the client doesn’t seem to care (consultancies with a strong reputation hardly ever get the discount question, been there myself);

• Gatekeepers: struggling with though gatekeepers (e.g. procurement) and not getting client air cover or support to get through the gatekeepers smoothly (again, it’s a big message if consultancies don’t get gatekeeper support);

• C-level: getting managed by lower-level team members, considering the consultancy as lower-level order takers, disconnected from the C-level;

• Measurement: getting measured on ‘hours performed’ instead of (transformational) outcomes. These consultancies are selling ‘availability’;

• Case studies: struggling to provide transformational case studies and social proof, because of the laundry list of services, it’s difficult to demonstrate specific, distinctive expertise (and it’s not doable from a workload perspective);

• Content: not really knowing what to write about to demonstrate expertise, build trust, improve visibility. I always check this first in my assessments, and I also ask Google what ‘trust stuff’ can be found from the consultancy;

More, these are the most frequent challenges I’ve encountered in the past few years.

## My three-pronged approach to addressing these symptoms

When I see multiple of these symptoms during my assessments, I immediately start working with a consultancy in 3 directions:

• Focus: create more focus (specialization). There’s no alternative (but it can be done in multiple ways);

• Outward view: move from an inward to outward view: understanding the buyers’ needs/wants and shift from an inward-looking laundry list service offering (‘here’s is what we do’) to a differentiating value proposition (‘here’s our pain-resolution impact’) step by step;

• Thought leadership: start to improve the evidence of expertise (micro thought leadership at the partner/owner level) via building and growing a reputational footprint (reputation = visibility x expertise x trust).

I spend much time helping the partners/owners understand how important it is to move to an outward view, starting from the prototypical pain points of their ideal clients and developing a new value proposition.

*Recommended reading:There Are Two Ways Of Doing Consulting, One Is ToxicValue propositions are based on the pain points, and that’s where the thought leadership gets built (problem-resolution advice and inspiring to make the transformational move).Those who have followed me for a while already know what I am talking about here.*

## Shift in consulting

The 2 main reasons for a massive shift in consulting in the past years (accelerated by the pandemic) are:

• Buying behavior: the way buyers buy has changed forever, I’ve explained this in  'The Big Question' in mynewsletter 44, and I haveposted about it on Linkedin;

• The era of specialists: prospects - confronted with an ever-growing complexity in the business - are looking for specialists to help them solve their problems. And the value proposition definition is the best way to attract prospects to the expertise. I’ve explained this ina post on Linkedin.

So, I hope that helps with your reflection in becoming a successful 2022 specialized consultancy firm.

# 3 Simple Content Hacks for Consultants

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 24 March 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/3-simple-content-hacks-for-consultants

---

"You need to share your knowledge," I tell consultancies. "You need to showcase your expertise by producing content that addresses your target audience's pain points, that offers insightful solutions, that sounds authentic. And you need to do all that on a consistent basis, measuring results and optimizing the process as you go."

If you know anything about me and what I do, then you know that this is the message I'm trying to get every consultant and consultancy to hear. Often, during such conversations, consultancies tell me they don’t know what to write about.Wow, I really don’t get that! Why not?

All right, so the overarching vision is to share your expertise and to educate your audience in order to build trust, right?

As Source Global Research points out in its recentstudy,87%of clients feel that trust has become a more important part of their purchasing decisions due to COVID.

Heck, TRUST is the blood in your consulting veins. So why is building and growing trust in your expertise so difficult?

That's why I am revealing in this article my simple hack of how to identify relevant topics for my target audience. I guarantee you that if you adopt this approach, you will never struggle to come up with topics for your thought leadership content. That's why I recommend that you start doing these tomorrow. Nay, TODAY!

## My sources of inspiration to build trust

Not all content is trust-building material. You can write generic articles until you're blue in the face and see no results.

> Don’t create to put something — anything — out there without considering if what you’re sharing is valuable or useful to your audience. (Felicia C. Sullivan)

Don’t create to put something — anything — out there without considering if what you’re sharing is valuable or useful to your audience. (Felicia C. Sullivan)

True thought leadership content doesn't shy away from addressing difficult subjects. On the contrary, it dives right in. Thought leadership content provides actual value – when it comes to consultancies, it's in the form of answers to questions that keep clients up at night.

According to research byGrist,60%of decision-makers use thought leadership content to evaluate the expertise/insight of potential advisors.

For more than a decade now, I have been consistent and persistent in building my reputational footprint. I wrote close to 250 case studies, articles, columns, and >1.500 LinkedIn posts.

This is my ultimate writing focus: ‘What knowledge did I acquire that would be valuable to share with my target audience?’The truth is that acontent-driven reputation is the only thing that is going to make you stand out in a crowded and very competitive consulting world. Now even more than before! The more you open up, the more your clients and prospects can relate to you as a consultant and expert. Solo, small, big consultancy? It doesn't matter at all.

So if you analyze your day-to-day work, you'll discover that almost every client and prospect interaction you have could be a potential source of content.

My Top 3 sources of inspiration, I call them my 'content hacks':

• Documenting and sharing prototypical client objections

• Documenting and sharing typical client problems advice

• Documenting and sharing project learnings

SUBSCRIBE TO 'THE AUTHORITY' NEWSLETTER

### #1. Document client objections

You should always be extremely eager to understand clients' objections and (immediately) document them. All the time. Obsessively.Right now, I have already documented three pages of objections/questions I’ve received from prospects and clients since I started my new consultancy in early 2020. This is gold.Every consultant/consultancy should systematically gather such objections to start building a FAQ (e.g., on the website) and to train (leaders AND team) the instant responses to prospect/client questions.As I always say: to learn your lines! And share it. Share. And share again.

### #2. Document prototypical client pains, struggles, challenges

As consultants, we need to study the patterns of success and failure and document them.Pattern detection is the foundation of expertise development. And if you don’t deliberately document them, you will struggle with growing your expertise and building/growing your reputational footprint.It should be one of the critical success components of winning pitches for every consultancy: your ability to explain patterns of success and failure to prospects/clients. Effortlessly!By the way, if your consultancy is all over the place with FOCUS, pattern discovery - and educating your audience - will be a nightmare.

So, document the patterns of client pains and share. Share. And share again.

### #3. Document project learnings

Consultancies should be case study writing machines and openly share them all the time.It should be your #1 driver of organic pipeline growth. Prospects come to you because they get attracted to the case studies.No detailed case studies - available with a click - mean poor social proof and this will always result in more business development stress and lower revenue.

I wrote >100 case studies in the past decade, and I openly shared them all the time. It was the #1 driver of organic pipeline growth in combination with these 3 characteristics:

• laser-sharp positioning (one audience, one prototypical pain, one value proposition)

• visibility in the market (to build trust)

• social proof (client testimonials)

## Documenting learnings, objections, and client pain points is a team effort

Consultants often tell me that they struggle to find the time to produce thought leadership content.

Now, the root of the problem, of course, needs to be addressed. However, this is where your team comes in. As a senior expert, you can easily plug in the rest of the team – junior consulting associates and marketers – to help you document learnings, objects, and client pain points.

Simply make sure to have a central depository of this information and divide responsibilities. Over time, optimize the process until it functions like a well-oiled machine. Under your leadership.

## The main takeaway

Here’s a short and simple version of the truth: without educating your target audience, you won’t be able to build TRUST in your expertise, grow your reputational footprint and stand out in a crowded consulting market (despite lots of opportunities).Everything you document should ultimately result in openly sharing trust-building ‘pain-resolution advice’ to your audience.Consistently. And it never stops. Never.

# 10 Business Development Challenges Consulting Is Struggling With

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 09 February 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/top-10-things-for-consulting-to-consider-in-2022

---

In January 2022, I hosted a webinar, where I presented my learnings from 2021. These are my observations on the world of consulting, what market trends have been shaping the way buyers make their decisions on purchasing consulting services.

I also reviewed the challenges I witnessed consulting is struggling with, and the types of business development and marketing strategies that allowed consultancies – both small and large – to withstand the test of time, of economic uncertainty, and changing buyer habits.

So today, I'd like to summarize these learnings and I urge all consultants to think about their own business model and identify ways to improve or optimize their business development strategies in 2022.

Here is the list. If you want to skip to a particular learning, click on it.

• Authority-Led: the need to build your reputational footprint

• FOMO remains the #1 toxic habit in consulting

• Laser-sharp Positioning is the foundation for consulting success

• Get rid of the inside view, move to the outside/client-view

• Specialization is key

• Sharing expertise: trust!

• The evil RFP? Maybe!

• Help, we have bad clients!

• OMG, we don’t have time!

• Outbound in consulting doesn’t work

## Learning #1: Authority-Led: the need to build your reputational footprint

Here's my ‘Authority-Led Approach’. It is a four-pronged approach:

• Positioning: a laser sharp definition of your business focus & value proposition

• Visibility: without visibility, you will seriously struggle with your business development

• Social proof: the need to build credibility with the help of previous projects

• Network: your network is the reward of your reputation, not your starting point

In 2021, I saw several of my clients improving their reputation in a specific expertise domain, and they started thriving. A few of them had their best year ever.

Amazing how an authority-led approach - done well - can have such a strong commercial impact. I am calling it your reputational footprint.

Reputation = expertise x visibility x trust

## Learning #2: FOMO remains the #1 toxic underlying challenge in consulting

I’ve been talking a lot about this already. It’s one of the most toxic underlying habits in consulting.

See alsomyLinkedin poston this subject. We live in a world full of restlessness and indecision. In consulting, that often translates into ‘keeping all the options open’ out of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). What I’ve seen the past year, more than ever before, in working with consultants is the chasm between:

• the indecisiveness to focus out of fear (to lose income/revenue) and

• the deep desire to be recognized as a consultant for specific, compelling expertise.

We seem to struggle to make deep commitments to become those long-haul heroes who courageously invest in particular expertise and stick to it for years. If you can’t commit, that misleading belief that we can be successful by keeping all options open will burn you out in the long run.

Deep fulfillment, satisfaction, and recognition come from becoming allergic to our infinite browsing mode. Keeping all options open in consulting is toxic. Solo consultant, boutique consultancy, big consultancy firm? There's no difference.

*Recommended reading:Want To Be a Furiously Successful Consultant? Put All Your Eggs in One Basket.*

## Learning #3: Laser-sharp Positioning is the foundation for consulting success

Robust positioning as a consultant or consultancy is the genesis of success in consulting (and therefore Quadrant #1, see the visual in Learning #1).

I cannot repeat it enough, success in consulting comes from a clear-cut positioning strategy:

• Narrow focus, deep expertise (with an obsession for repetition and pattern recognition)

• Specific target audience with specific, prototypical pains

• Client-specific value proposition with a distinct problem-resolution process

Poorly positioned consultancies will always struggle with a multitude of business development goals. They often get under mental pressure to start selling downstream availability (order takers instead of transformational experts) and usually start overservicing the clients at too low a price. Poor positioning is a losing battle in both visibility and trust-building with prospects.

Stop going there. There’s too much saturation in the crowded, competitive consulting market, too many competitors doing the same thing.

## Learning #4: Get rid of the inside view, move to the outside/client-view

I learned that consultants and consultancies have a tough time getting rid of their incredible inside view. Almost unanimously, their websites sound like this: we are the best in this, the best in that, we are unique, we are award-winning, we have a collective experience of 80 years, we are innovative, leading, passionate, result-focused, client-centered, and fascinated about teamwork. Amazing.

Who cares what you are fascinated about? Everybody says that. Here’s what you should think and talk about:

• Where's the client in all this?

• And which clients are you focusing on anyway?

• What are the pains of the client you can transform?

• What is the specific transformation you can deliver for those prototypical pains?

• What is your point of view about this prototypical client pain?

• What is the value or impact you will have?

• Where’s your value proposition?

• Where is your specific social proof about your useless we-we-we vanity claims?

Do you really believe you differentiate by telling the world you are passionate (that monster cliche)? Useless, self-centered bragging. Unappealing and pure commodity. Write this down and stick it to the office wall:

"It's not about what you think you are (inside view), but about what transformational impact for the client you can have (outside view)".Stop with your (inside-driven) self-love. It’s not what it is but what it does.

*Recommended reading:Your Consulting Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying Decision*

## Learning #5: Specialization is key

It’s one of the biggest debates I am having with consultants, and (driven by FOMO, Ego, Pleasing Syndrome, etc.) they keep challenging me on my specialization mission. I get all kinds of pushback, but I hope that, if you read the previous learnings, you get the idea that - given the fierce competition in the market - you’d better stand out with ‘something’ or you better find a regular job. Really.

Until now, none of the objections I receive have ever been proven: eg.

• the risk that certain specializations could get less attractive in the market (well, you need to stay agile, keep finetuning your service offering, be a T-shaped specialist)

• the boredom of doing the same thing (repetition to learn all the patterns is an incredible discovery journey, I’ve been there and never/ever got bored)

• missing out on opportunities (doing less to achieve more, yes that works, seriously)

Here’s what I learned: specialization in consulting is a superpower! Here are 7 wonderful outcomes of commitment to specialization:

• You will have more time growing the business;

• You will move to a higher-quality life, instead of running in the downstream treadmill;

• You will be able to charge premium prices, and you won’t be challenged a lot;

• You will get recognized as an expert, your infinite energy supply;

• You will know everything, you can always/anytime answer all the questions; countering strenuous client objections is a walk in the park;

• Clients will come to you, and you won’t have to sell, persuade, negotiate a lot;

• Your love for your craft will let you sleep well and protect you against stress or burnout.

While most consultancies and consultants try to beeverything, depth and specialization are superpowers. Variety in consulting is hell.

## Learning #6: Sharing expertise to build trust!

Business development in consulting has changed forever. I’ve been talking a lot about it in the past year. Consulting is a 100% trust-based business. Buyers of consulting services have access to an abundance of information that empowers them to navigate (confirmed by research) 70-80% of the decision-making process before they contact a consultancy.

So, you’d better get included in ‘the buyers’ homework’. There’s still tremendous opportunity in consulting, but you will need a robust reputation footprint to win in a crowded, highly competitive consulting market with risk-avoiding, impatient buyers who can find anything in seconds.

You need to have a bold point of view and a fundamentally new way to solve the problem(s) of your target audience. Your main goal is to inspire them with the transformational potential of your expertise, picture them ‘The Promised Land’, and educate them to move away from their status quo. Business development in consulting is all about building and growing trust at scale.In the new world, you no longer have a choice: you will need to develop and share the best possible educational content consistently. If you don’t, you’ll belong to the loser's camp sooner or later. Seriously. Solo consultant, a boutique consultancy, or big firm? There’s no difference! It’s the buyer, stupid. Experts write and share.

## Learning #7: The evil RFP? Maybe!

It has been another year of discussions about the evil RFP. I get that. But, believe it or not, I know a whole range of consultancies and consultants who get invited without any RFP process. I even know a few who refuse to play the RFP game, and in 70-80% of the cases, they successfully push back. Why is that? These consultancies are known for their unparalleled expertise and reputation. They get invited because the prospect wants them.I enjoyed most of the RFP’s I was involved in because it was effortless to demonstrate expertise if the client had done the homework (in 95% of the cases). Evil procurement people? I don’t know. I’m seeing that experts who get invited seem to get ‘air cover’ from the client.And yes, there are nasty gatekeepers. They exist. But ask yourself: is it about your (still missing) expertise and reputation level or is it about ‘the ugly others’? Take a deep breath.

Interesting in reading an excellent RFP-related article from author David C. Baker?You can find it here.

## Learning #8: Help, we have bad clients!

Another returning discussion in my working with consultants/consultancies: the so-called difficult clients. Suppose you are a thru follower of my writings...

In that case, you probably already know my pushback: all those bad clients just don’t exist, you have made them bad by selling your unlimited availability, by allowing bad behaviors and processes, by accepting the gatekeepers, by authorizing big discounts, and many more reasons (I wrote aLinkedIn post).

And the reason why you are doing this is that you are afraid of losing the client. Fearful of losing income, of losing revenue, of losing your incentive. So, even unconsciously, you quickly slide into one of the most toxic consulting illnesses: over-servicing and undercharging.And it all starts with ‘being like all other consultancies’: not having the power in the collaboration because you lack authority, visibility, and reputation. The client is buying your availability and is not (yet) inviting you for your robust transformational expertise and impact.Suppose you don’t fanatically tackle your very own underlying fear of losing the client. In that case, you will unfortunately never achieve an unambiguous authority positioning to stand out in a competitive consulting market, and your mental health will be at stake in the long run.

## Learning #9: OMG, we don’t have time!

Another stubborn discussion: not having time to build the necessary reputation footprint (visibility x expertise x trust).

Suppose you don’t build a solid reputational footprint. In that case, you will have to sell your availability at a low hourly rate, you will have to work and sell like crazy to protect income/revenue, and you won’t have the critical time to grow the business. It’s what I call the vicious loop to hell (and burnout).

Your consulting business will never grow if you don’t dedicate 20-30% of your time to deepening your expertise, boosting your reputation, and getting invited at premium rates to compensate for the 20-30% business development.

However, finding the time to build your reputation as a consultant is NOT BY THE CLOCK! It’s by reverse-engineering the fundamentals of your consulting business: focus/expertise, reputation, pipeline by invitation, premium pricing, 20-30% biz-dev. The glorious loop to heaven (and quality of life).

*Recommended reading:You Will Always Have a Time Problem as a Consultant Until You Do This*

## Learning #10: Cold outbound in consulting doesn’t work

I am still getting confronted with consultancies trying to make stupid outbound sales. I even crossed paths with two mid-sized consultancy firms, both using a call center making cold calling sales.I was flabbergasted. Cold calling in consulting? Wow, that doesn’t work. Why not? In 99% of the cases, prospects - if the call agent can reach the right decision-makers at all (likely NEVER) - are not in need to buy consulting services. And potential buyers cannot be inspired by a call agent who has no clue (with all due respect).Cold calling? Cold outbound? Forget it. Such a waste of time and money. What should you be doing instead as a consultancy? If you know me: it’s easy to understand. The consultants will need to become a magnet of their expertise. How?Here’s the thing: effective selling in consulting requires YOU to build TRUST in YOUR expertise. Share, teach, share, teach. Build and grow your reputation as a consultancy with your consultants. Inspire your prospects with an abundance of ‘trust stuff’. Nurture them with the latest insights, trends, research, lessons learned, use cases. Consistently.Once you get in the trust-building flow, your ‘sales life’ will radically change. You won’t need call centers again. Unfortunately, there are no trust-building hacks. It takes time. A year, two years, maybe even more. It’s a long-haul play.

Ooh, I almost forgot to say: and it never stops! But I am damn sure you’ll start getting a flood of prospects coming through. It happened to me twice. Starting from scratch. Stop your stupid consulting call center practice! You can’t delegate trust-building to a call center.Sleazy sales hacks in consulting don’t work! You are fooling yourself. And you will be destroying your reputation.

## In conclusion

I help consultants and consultancy firms with authority-led business development. This is what I do and this is my passion. So I have talked to hundreds of consultants by now and continue to have these conversations on a regular basis.

I see a lot of push back, a lot of hesitancy to change. And I understand that. As someone who started my business from scratch right before the pandemic hit, I have first-hand knowledge of the fears that come with change.

However, I also know that, as consultants, we must be agile. We must keep our finger on the pulse of the industry and be willing to adjust the way we do business when the market requires us to do so. It's either evolve or become a dinosaur.

The things I listed today, I strongly encourage you to consider them as you plan and/or rethink your next quarter, your next year, your next five years. Nothing has to happen overnight, but you do have to start making changes today. The long haul, you know.

# “Why Should We Hire Your Consultancy?” Here Is How to Answer

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 17 January 2022
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-should-we-hire-you-as-a-consultant

---

“Why should we hire your consulting firm?” Consultants get this question a lot. Most have ready-to-serve answers:

• “X number of years of experience”

• “Unmatched capabilities”

• “The use of the latest technologies”

• “Unparalleled commitment to quality”

• "We are client-centered and team-oriented"

Here is where I stand on this...

Ordinary consulting firms pitch and get ‘the why question’ from the client. Go-to expert consultancies get invited and ask clients ‘the why question’ to (dis)qualify the support request.

## Consulting is a credence business

Prospects need to find, like, and trust us before they buy. Research says that 70-80% of the ‘homework’ is done before prospects contact consultants to discuss support.

A recentSource Global Research(specialized in researching professional services) study mentions that less than half of all consulting engagements seem to create a value that exceeds the fees paid. Wow, what a surprisingly low score!I recommend checking out this HBRarticle(‘How to tell if hiring a consultant will be worth the investment’).So, no wonder prospects will assess the consultancy: can they deliver value to us? It’s not a nasty, evil question at all.

Getting the why-should-we-hire-you question is a symptom of a lack of trust in you or your consultancy (or in consulting in general).

*Recommended reading:Your Consulting Positioning Has the Single Biggest Impact on the Buying Decision*

## Don’t start arguing with the prospect

I’ve seen it way too often; most consultants’ mindsets switch into defense mode by getting the why question. They feel the need to justify, convince, and claim to have the expertise.

Deep inside, they feel mistreated and misunderstood.

Unfortunately, they can rarely win by defending the why question because they might have lost the game already. And if they try to persuade the prospect, they will come across as either weak, desperate, arrogant, or maybe even a bullshitter.

It’s a harsh statement, I know.70-80% of the selling should be done before consultancy firms even engage with the prospect in a project discussion. The consultancy's digital footprint should be powerful enough to convince the prospect that:

• The consultancy is truly an expert on the client's problem (and explains the prototypical problems of the client in the slightest detail);

• The consultancy has delivered high-level client results with similar problems (testimonials of referenceable clients);

• The consultancy has a strong point of view and can explain the business case for the pain-solving approach (it's easy to understand why the client should invest);

• The consultancy consistently educates its clients and prospects on how to make the shift (to solve the problem) and can explain the cost and risk of inaction.

I've been there many times in the past decade. With all of the above, I never had to sell, persuade or negotiate. I didn't get the why question at all.

## What should be your answer?

I learned this many years ago from the ‘Win Without Pitching Manifesto’ book and the articles of Blair Enns. Here’s what I learned to say:

“I appreciate the question but I don’t consider it as my job to talk you into hiring me/us so why don’t I tell you why our clients typically hire me/us”.Inevitably, that requires the immediate availability, top of mind, of transformative client cases or client feedback you can explain.

And, of course, those cases should fit into the prospect’s ballgame (the referenceable case study, as I call it).

Hardcore social proof is the only way to address the why question in the right way, hopefully. That’s why I’ve invested 80% of my writing time in the past in writing compelling, transformative case studies and business cases to invest in our support.

## Don’t (only) look at your competitors

When we lose a pitch, we tend to look at the competition. That’s OK. We should be fully aware of our competitors and why they win pitches.

However, competition in consulting is not always what we think.

More often than we assume, I've seen with my consulting clients that it’s about the buyer who’s not willing to switch to them.

Why? Because of a too low trust level and/or lack of outcome-rich case studies from other clients in similar shoes. It's not (always) about the competition. It’s about themselves.If a consultancy constantly has to defend itself, it should re-assess its approach. The journey starts inwards.

*Recommended reading:Why You Should Reverse-Engineer Your Consulting Service Offering*

## The ugly stuff: why did you get invited?

70-80% of the buyer’s homework is done before you get invited. So why did they invite your consulting firm and ask you the why question? Poor homework? Not at all.Here are some brutal consulting realities:

• your consultancy is probably #3 in the pitch (‘the benchmark candidate’);

• the prospect is ghosting your consultancy to get some free advice;

• the prospect is exploiting your (desperate) lower rates to negotiate with ‘the others’;

• the prospect invited your consultancy because they need three proposals to remain compliant.

## The main takeaway

The why question is a symptom of a lack of trust in the consultancy's expertise to solve the client's problem.

If the consulting firm gets asked that question more often, the prospect doesn't consider you as the go-to experts yet and you’d better give it some reflection.Simply put: the why-should-we-hire-you question measures the authority of a consultancy.

Consistency might make you feel like a loser.

Contrary to public opinion, deliberate practice and not talent is the key to becoming extraordinary. (Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool in their book 'Peak')

There are so many consultants in the world that are so much more talented than you. They’re sexier. Smarter. Richer. More creative. More likable, more charming, and better-connected. But there is one, singular thing you can do better than them:

You can outperform them through repetition.

This sheer commitment to keep-going-no-matter-what beats your stronger opponent, every time. Prolific actor Will Smith was once asked how he got to be so successful in his career:

> The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things. But if we get on the treadmill together, there are two things: You’re getting off first, or I’m going to die. (Will Smith)

The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things. But if we get on the treadmill together, there are two things: You’re getting off first, or I’m going to die. (Will Smith)

Anybody can cultivate this discipline. Any consultant. It’s the single most effective strategy to outperform the toughest competitors you’ll ever face in your consulting business. You just need to be consistent and start loving the illusive boredom of repeatability in your consulting work.

Consultants are telling me they love the variety in their work. My answer: in the long run, variety will start frustrating you and burning you out. Variety comes at the expense of expertise. Expertise comes through repetition and pattern detection. I stayed in my lane for almost a decade and I never got bored. Never.

## The Big Riches Are in the Niches

Most consultants operate from a fear-based mindset, taking almost any work that pays and “keeping their options open” so they don’t miss the potential income.

Read about FOMO - the fear of missing out - in my other blog.

Unfortunately, this is the exact position that keeps them locked into their income bracket and expertise. There is no chance for a consultant to become a recognized visible authority in their field if they focus on multiple domains out of fear of missing out. Keeping the options open is extremely toxic.

This reactive thinking, responding to whatever the world, prospects, or clients throw at you, severely limits consultants. It strengthens the risk to remain in mediocrity. If you don’t take charge of your business, someone else will. As the great executive coach Marshall Goldsmith once wrote:

> If you don’t create and control your environment, your environment will create and control you. (Marshall Goldsmith)

If you don’t create and control your environment, your environment will create and control you. (Marshall Goldsmith)

Becoming a master of a niche might seem boring. It might be scary saying no to ill-suited consulting opportunities and money. What if your project pipeline gets dry? What if you’re not good enough?

But when you choose to specialize, you place yourself in control of your consulting business. It forces an important ultimatum on yourself — get better, or go broke.

And that changes everything. It game-changed my life. It can change your life. It can change your family’s life.

Start loving 'the boredom' of consistency and repeatability. It’s the backbone of your authority — and your consulting business. The repeatability of your work will transform you into an unquestionable expert and visible authority. Through repetition, you will learn the deeper patterns, challenges, risks, and solutions that 99% of your competition will never know because they weren’t willing to put in the work.

The so-called boredom of repeatability, what consultants keep telling me, is an illusion.

I’ve explained this in my other blog: 'Why you should say no to grow your consulting business'.

You cannot be successful if you keep focusing on multiple domains as a consultant, keeping the options open. There’s too much saturation, too many competitors doing the same thing. It’s a losing battle in both visibility (search engines/online traffic) and trust-building with prospects. Consulting is based on trust, and you must make potential clients fully trust you’re the #1 person for the job.

There are big riches in the niches.

### Anything Worth Learning Is Going to Suck

> Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.  (Mark Manson)

Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience.  (Mark Manson)

The road to successful consulting isn’t always fun. You don’t run and skip and play on that road — you trudge it, one step at a time.

As a teenager, I grew up with the successes of cyclist champion Eddy Merckx. In interviews, it always annoyed him to be called ‘an exceptional talent’ because it took away from the thousands of hours of training. He kept repeating: “Cyclists live with pain. If you can’t handle it, you will win nothing”.

As my favorite best-selling author James Altucher once put it:

> Anything worth learning, you’re going to suck. You’re going to suck badly.  (James Altucher)

Anything worth learning, you’re going to suck. You’re going to suck badly.  (James Altucher)

Whatever skill you want to master comes at a price

It takes time, perhaps thousands of hours. It takes full concentration. It might mean waking up early and studying late when you could have watched a movie on Netflix. The reason most consultants never pass the “apprentice” phrase isn’t that they’re unable. More often, it’s because they’re not willing to put in the repetition and having the patience to build authority.

They’re not willing to specialize in a field and put in the hours and hours it takes to become a true authority in their craft, well-known in their market or industry. Authorities are not made by doing many things decently, but by consistently doing one thing expertly. This is where true consulting revenue really starts to flow.

In fact, most consultants don’t even believe they could become a master of anything, so they stay in the “security” of consulting as a jack-of-all-trades, keeping their options open while forfeiting the enormous potential income in a specialty.

I am a big fan of uber-successful author-entrepreneur Tim Ferriss. He once wrote:

> It’s lonely at the top, 99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive. (Tim Ferriss)

It’s lonely at the top, 99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive. (Tim Ferriss)

Most consultants will not press through the difficult initial phases of mastery. Mastery has a price, and most consultants aren’t willing to pay it. But for those who do? Anything is possible. If you want to stop fighting for scraps with the other 99%, it’s time to train yourself to enter in the top 1% — which actually has less competition!

I never had to explain, persuade, sell or negotiate in my consulting career. I got invited. If you can get through the illusive boredom of consistency and repeatability, you can achieve truly enormous goals.

> Repetition can be boring or tedious, which is why so few people ever master anything. (Hal Elrod)

### Ordinary Consultants Focus on the Outcome. Extraordinary Consultants Focus On Process Repitition

What would it do for you if you could walk into any business room to pitch your expertise and feel relaxed and free? How does it feel to be considered as an expert instead of a vendor like all the others? How would it feel to get invited to conference keynotes around the world (pre-Corona, of course)? How would it feel to have power in any consulting situation you walked into? How does it feel to be able to answer all the questions and objections without having to think?

What would happen if you could be a high-level consultant with no pressure, free to achieve any goal you wanted? That’s how I felt all those years.

Ordinary consultants focus on the outcome. They focus on getting top contracts and being famous. But extraordinary consultants focus on process repetition — becoming world-class at their craft, becoming authorities in their expertise domain. This is how they achieve such enormous goals, while 99% of their competition stays average.

Ordinary consultants protect their income. Authorities protect their time.

Any consultant who relies solely on luck, talent, or prestige doesn’t understand this lesson and will suffer for it. It may help them in the beginning, but the best and highest-earning consultants have learned to design a lifestyle based on their visible authority, not good fortune or luck.

The best consultants were, at one point, pretty bad. Everything is difficult before it becomes easy.

The best consultants, however, don’t rely on luck. They don’t wait for inspiration to train or do the work. They just do it. By focusing on the process repetition — doing the work, day in and day out, repeating 100x, and understanding all the patterns that clients are willing to pay a premium rate for — they become stronger, faster, more focused, more skilled, and more visible in their market.

> Putting in years of effort gave me the privilege of becoming a visible authority globally. It didn’t happen overnight though. It took a lot of hard work, a structured and process-driven approach, and a laser-sharp focus. I never left my lane. (Luk Smeyers)

### In Conclusion

Consistency and repetition might seem boring at first sight. Repeating everything you do 100x. Sometimes it will make you feel like a loser. You might feel like you’re narrowing your focus too much, missing out on potential clients. The work isn’t always sexy, and you won’t see results for a while.

This is where I see most consultants quit and believe they play it safe by sticking to the same old generalist consulting approach. They believe they will be successful by covering multiple domains and by keeping all options open.

Unfortunately, it’s a losing battle. There’s too much saturation, too many competitors doing the same thing. But if you can push through the dip — if you can keep putting in the work in your business even when it feels like you’re going nowhere,  you can achieve extraordinary results. Repetition and focus are consulting gold.

# Why Thought Leadership Will Be Developing A Consulting Business

**Autor:** Luk Smeyers
**Data:** 28 May 2020
**Link:** https://www.thevisibleauthority.com/blog/why-thought-leadership-will-be-developing-a-consulting-business

Openly sharing all my learnings has enabled me to create consulting opportunities that I would not have had otherwise.

Putting in the effort toward creating valuable content gave me the privilege of becoming a ‘visible authority’ globally. It didn’t happen overnight. It took a lot of hard work, a structured approach, and a laser-sharp focus.

Read here my separate blog postwith all the results I was able to achieve in the past years.

Amplifying your visibility as a subject matter expert is more than a feel-good marketing technique. When done deliberately, systematically, and strategically, it is a proven business development and inbound marketing tool and there’s ample research to back up this claim.

Here’s where I got the evidence from:

• The famous (annual) Edelman 2020 ‘B2B Thought Leadership Impact’ study

• The Longitude (a company of the Financial Times) ‘Learning From Leaders’ study

• The Grist ‘Value of B2B Thought Leadership’ study

• The Economist Group and Hill+Knowlton Strategies 'Thought Leadership Disrupted' study

### Here's the infographic of all the data from this blog:

## 3 Ways how thought leadership helps with customer acquisition

### 1. It adds credibility

The findings of Edelman’s 2020 edition of its annualB2B Thought Leadership Impactstudy alone should be an eye-opener for consultants.

89% of decision makers believe that thought leadership can be effective in enhancing their perceptions of an organization they are interested in collaborating with.

Producing content that adds value -- be it in the form of written articles, speaking engagements, or both -- puts a spotlight on your expertise.

Anyone can write a generic article that barely scratches the surface of a topic.

It’s the subject matter expert who can provide a more in-depth, educational or analytical type of content, which allows decision makers to identify specialists in a sea of generalists.

### 2. It is perceived as more authentic

The same study reveals that:

59% of senior executives perceive thought leadership to be a more trustworthy basis for assessing an organization’s capabilities and competencies than its marketing materials and product sheets.

Such content tends to be more authentic. It doesn’t have the obvious sales layer and is instead focused on providing relevant insights.

69% of decision makers believe that thought leadership is one of the best ways to understand the type and caliber of an organization’s thinking.

This number goes to show that your potential clients are very likely to make up their mind about which consultant or organization to hire based on the level of expertise they perceive you or your organization to have.

In fact, a different study conducted by The Financial Times company, Longitude, titledLearning from Leaders, found that:

87% of executives were influenced by the quality of thought leadership provided during a sales process to decide on who to award a deal.

### 3. It helps you get noticed by your target audience and generate inbound leads

According to the study by Grist,Value of B2B Thought Leadership:

Senior executives see thought leadership content as a valuable tool to stay ahead of emerging trends (66%) and to make better, more informed decisions (60%).

As such, they actively seek out high-level, informative content.

Citing once again Edelman’s study:

48% of decision makers spend at least 1 hour a week reading thought leadership articles(31% - 1-3 hrs, and 17% - 4+ hrs).

As a consultant, you are drastically increasing your chances of getting noticed for your expertise by potential clients if you create unique, thought-provoking content and promote it via channels your potential clients utilize on a daily basis.

Furthermore, the Grist study found:

40% of decision makers will speak to the firm that produced thought leadership content when it hits the mark.

This type of conversion is unparalleled. When it comes to inbound marketing, nothing comes close in terms of ROI to high-quality thought leadership.

What channels and techniques can you use to place your content as a consultant?

Well, let’s turn to data again. According to the study by Grist:

Senior executives are most likely to seek thought leadership content from 44% - professional services / advisory firms (44%), industry events (43%), and online search (40%).

This leads to the natural conclusion that you should be actively publishing and promoting your content on your consultancy’s page and social media channels, presenting at relevant industry events, and paying attention to optimization of your content for relevant keywords.

## How to produce thought leadership content that stands out?

Of course, not every piece of writing out there can be considered “thought leadership” and, even if it is, you still need to fight for the attention of relevant decision makers.

To help you figure out exactly what type of content to produce, I supplement recommendations from my personal experience with those identified by studies.

According to Edelman’s study:

46% of executives prefer content in the form of case studies, 37% - shorter research-based articles, 35% - opinion pieces, 33% - interactive data tools, and 22% - long research-based reports.

Grist’s study reveals that decision makers are looking for:

Content that explores issues or challenges from new and different perspectives (46%) and analysis of important or emerging trends (32%).

However, with the amount of content available online and at various industry events, it comes as no surprise that senior executives are rather selective about which content they consume.

As reported by a study by The Economist Group and Hill+Knowlton Strategies, over 80% of decision makers cite the volume of content as the main reason for their high level of selectiveness.

As for the length of content, let’s once again turn to Grist’s findings:

63% of senior executives prefer short articles of 800 words, 57% - blog posts of 300-500 words, 45% - feature articles of 1,200+ words, and 28% - white papers/research reports of up to 4,000 words.

## This is how I've built my thought leadership

People keep asking me – often somewhat skeptically – if my hard thought leadership work has paid off all those years.

I get those questions because becoming visible with valuable content is something most consultants really struggle with. The truth though is that visibility is the only thing that is going to make you stand out in a crowded and very competitive consulting world.

The biggest blunder that consultants can make is to think that somehow potential clients will find them. Nothing could be further from reality.

It wasn’t always easy to produce valuable content. Not every swing was a hit. But it never felt like an uphill battle to me and sharing my expertise has enabled me to create opportunities that I would not have had otherwise.

Instead of developing short-lived content with the aim of telling potential clients how great we were (which would have been a darn uphill battle), I always focused on sharing deep experience and knowledge. The teacher in me kept asking:

• What did I learn in the project trenches about the biggest client pains that others could learn from?

• Which experiences did I acquire that could be valuable for others?

• What were the unique client stories (with successes and struggles) that could inspire others to pursue better outcomes?

Marketing yourself as a consultant is surprisingly easy! Share your unique stories and experiences in an authentic and passionate way and you will organically create a strong and loyal client base!

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I’ve always been surprised that by sharing my stories from the front line I was able to outperform the visibility of thousands of top consultants at Deloitte globally.

The more content I shared, the bigger the results.

It’s a little bit like a real estate developer: the bigger the assets, the bigger the results. I’ve always considered my articles to be the assets of my library.

The more assets I had, the bigger my follower community became, the more traffic to the website I generated, the wider my reach and visibility got, the bigger the output became. Here’s an overview of the ‘secret weapon’ I was able to unlock for the business.

Read here my blogwith the results of openly sharing my expertise and thought leadership.

## My final recommendations

Make your content stand out by:

• tailoring it to the needs and the pains of your (very narrow!) audience,

• generating this content frequently and systematically,

• paying attention to the distribution of content just as much as to the creation of content.

Hopefully, the data that I’ve cited in this article convinced you of the power of thought leadership when it comes to building a strong reputation among your target audience, generating leads, and converting them into clients.

I recommend that you find a balance between producing content on a regular basis and maintaining its high quality. Your potential clients are turning to thought leadership pieces in search of trends, insights, and analysis.
